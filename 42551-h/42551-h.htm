and of frier Martin Ignacio, that went out of Spaine vnto

went in their companie, for to passe from the Ilands Philipinas,

of the entrie they made therein, and what they did see there
for the space of foure monethes and sixteene daies that they
remained: and of what they vnderstood, and of al things
that happened vnto them, till they returned againe vnto the
ilands from whence they went: all the which are notable
and strange.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spanyards departe from Mexico vnto the Ilandes Phillipinas, where
they had intelligence of the mightie kingdome of China.</i></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Gouerning</span> in the kingdom of Mexico, Don Luys de
Velasco, who was viceroye, and lieftenant in that place for the
Catholike king Don Philip king of Spaine, was commanded
by his maiestie to prepare a great armie in the South Sea,
and to leuie souldiers necessarie for the same, and to send
them to discouer the ilands of the west, those which that
famous captaine Magallanes did giue notice of when he did
compasse the world in the ship called the Victorie.</p>

<p>The viceroy with great care and diligence did performe
the kinges commandement. This fleete and armie being
prepared readie (which was not without great cost), hee
caused them to depart out of the port at Christmas time in
the yeare of 1564; and sent, for general of the same fleet and
for gouernour of that countrie which they should discouer,
the worthie Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, who afterwarde died in
the said Ilande with the title of Adelantado, a yeare after that
the fathers Fryer Martin de Herrada and Fryer Geronimo
Marin and their companies did enter into China.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_4" id="Page_ii_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>So after that our Spaniardes hadde discouered the sayde
ilandes, and some of them populared to the vse of his maiestie,
but in especiall that of Manilla, which is fiue hundred
leagues in circuit; in the which is situated the citie of
Luson, and is also called Manilla, and as the metropolitane
of all the iland, whereas the gouernours haue ordeined their
place of abiding euer since the first discouery. They haue
also founded in that citie a cathedrall church, and erected a
bishopricke.</p>

<p>And for bishops of the same, his maiestie did ordaine the
most reuerend fryer Don Domingo de Salazar, of the order
of preachers, in whom was comprehended some holinesse,
good life, and learning, as was requisite and necessarie for that
prouince: and was consecrated in Madrid the yeare of 1579.</p>

<p>At this present there be three monasteries of religious men
in that iland, the one of the order of S. Austen, and were
the first that by the commandement of his maiestie did enter
into this iland, preaching the law of the gospell, which was
great profit vnto those soules, yet great trauaile vnto them,
and cost many of them their liues in dooing it: the other
monasterie is of barefoote fryers of the order of S. Francis,
of the prouince of S. Joseph, who haue beene great examples,
with great profit vnto them of those portes. The
third are of the order of S. Dominicke or preachers, who
haue done their dutie in all things so well as the other.
These three orders were alonely in those ilands for certaine
yeares, till now of late time haue gone thither Jesuites,
which haue bin a great aide and helpe vnto their religion.</p>

<p>When these Spaniardes were come vnto these ilands, they
had strightwaies notice of the mightie kingdome of China,
as well by the relation of them of the ilands (who tolde vnto
them the maruels thereof), as also within a fewe daies
after they did see and vnderstand, by ships that came into
those ports with marchants, that brought marchandise and
other things of great curiositie from that kingdome, and did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_5" id="Page_ii_5">[5]</a></span>
particularly declare the mightinesse and riches thereof: all
which haue been declared vnto you in the first three bookes
of this historie. This beeing knowen vnto the religious
people of S. Austin, who at that time were alone in those
ilands, but in especiall vnto the prouinciall, Frier Martin
de Herrada, a man of great valour and wel learned in all
sciences, who seeing y<sup>e</sup> great capacitie or towardnesse which
the Chinos had more than those of the Ilandes in all
things, but in especiall of their gallantnesse, discretion,
and wit, he straightwaies had a great desire to go thether
with his fellow to preach the gospell vnto those people, of so
good a capacitie to receiue the same: who with a pretended
purpose to put it in vse and effect, he began with great care
and studie to learne that language, the which he learned in
a few daies, and did make thereof a dictionarie. Then afterwards,
they did giue great entertainment and presents vnto
the merchants that came from China, for to procure them to
carie them thether, and many other things, the which did
shew their holie zeale; yea, they did offer themselues to bee
slaues vnto the marchants, thinking by y<sup>t</sup> meanes to enter in
to preach: but yet none of these diligences did take effect,
till such time as the diuine maiestie did discover a better
way, as shalbe declared vnto you in this chapter following.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_I_II" id="CHAP_I_II"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A rouer of this kingdome of China called Limahon, doth make himselfe
strong at the sea, and doth ouercome an other rouer of the same
countrie called Vintoquiam.</i></p></div>



<p>The Spaniards did enioy their new habitation of Manilla
in great quietnesse, voide of all care of any accident that
might disquiet them, or any strange treasons of enimies for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_6" id="Page_ii_6">[6]</a></span>
to offend them; for that those Ilandes were in great quietnes,
and in obedience vnto the Christian king Don Phillip,
and in continuall traficke with the Chinos, which seemed
vnto them a sufficient securitie for the continuance of the
quietnesse they liued in. And againe, for that they vnderstoode
that they had a law amongst them (as hath bin told
you in this historie), y<sup>t</sup> it was forbidden to make any wars
out of their owne countrie. But being in this security and
quietnes, vnlooked for, they were beset with a mightie and
great armada or fleete of ships, by the rouer Limahon, of
whose vocation there are continually on y<sup>t</sup> coast, the one by
reason y<sup>t</sup> the country is full of people, wheras of necessitie
must be many idle persons; and the other and principall
occasion, by reason of the great tyranny y<sup>t</sup> the gouernors
doo vse vnto the subjects. This Limahon came vpon them
with intent to do them harme, as you shal vnderstand.
<span class="sidenote">Where Limahon was borne.</span>
This rouer was borne in the citie of Trucheo, in the prouince
of Cuytan, which the Portingals do call Catin. He
was of mean parentage, and brought vp in his youth in
liberty and vice: hee was by nature warlike and euill inclined.
He would learne no occupation, but all giuen to
robbe in the high waies, and became so expert that many
came vnto him and followed that trade. He made himself
captain ouer them which were more then two thousand, and
were so strong y<sup>t</sup> they were feared in all that prouince where
as they were. This being knowen vnto the king and to his
councell, they did straight way command the viceroy of the
prouince where as the rouer was, that with all the haste
possible he should gather together all the garrisons of his
frontyers, to apprehende and take him, and if it were possible
to carrye him aliue vnto the citie of Taybin, if not his
head. The viceroy incontinent did gather together people
necessarie and in great haste to followe him.</p>


<p>The which being knowen vnto Limahon the rouer, who
saw that, with the people he had, he was not able to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_7" id="Page_ii_7">[7]</a></span>
resistance against so great a number as they were, and the
eminent danger that was therein, he called together his companies,
and went from thence vnto a port of the sea, that was
a few leagues from that place; and did it so quickly and in
such secret, that before the people that dwelt therein could
make any defence (for that they were not accustomed to any
such assaultes, but liued in great quietnesse), they were
lordes of the port and of all such ships as were there: into
the which they imbarked themselues straightwaies, wayed
anker and departed to the sea, whereas they thought to bee
in more securitie than on the lande (as it was true). Then
hee seeing himselfe lorde of all those seas, beganne to robbe
and spoyle all shippes that he could take, as well strangers
as of the naturall people: by which meanes, in a small time,
hee was prouided of mariners and other things which before
hee lacked, requisite for that new occupation. He sacked,
robbed, and spoyled all the townes that were vpon the
coast, and did verie much harme. So he finding himselfe
verie strong with fortie shippes well armed, of those he had
out of the port, and other that he had taken at the sea, with
much people such as were without shame, their handes
imbrued with robberie and killing of men, hee imagined
with himselfe to attempt greater matters, and did put it in
execution: he assaulted great townes, and did a thousand
cruelties: in such sort, that on all that coast whereas hee
was knowen, he was much feared, yea and in other places
farther off, his fame was so published abroad. So he following
this trade and exercise, he chanced to meete with an
other rouer as himselfe, called Vintoquian, likewise naturally
borne in China, who was in a port voide of any care or
<span class="sidenote">One rouer robbed another.</span>
mistrust, whereas Limahon finding opportunitie, with greater
courage did fight with the shippes of the other: and although
they were threescore ships great and small, and good souldiers
therein, hee did ouercome them, and tooke fiue and
fiftie of their ships. So that Vintoquian escaped with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_8" id="Page_ii_8">[8]</a></span>
five ships. Then Limahon, seeing himselfe with a fleete
of nintie fiue shippes well armed, and with many stout
people in them, knowing that if they were taken, they
should be all executed to death: they therefore setting all
feare a part, gaue themselues to attempt new inuentions of
euill, not onely in robbing of great cities, but also in destroying
of them.</p>

<p>The complayntes increased euerie day more and more
vnto the king and his counsell, of the euils doone vnto the
Chinos by this rouer Lymahon. For the which commandement
was giuen straightwaies vnto the uiceroy of that prouince
(whereas he vsed to execute his euill), that with great
expedition he might be taken (for to cut off this inconuenience),
who in few dayes did set foorth to sea, one hundred
<span class="sidenote">One hundred and thirtie great ships of

and thirtie great shippes well appointed, with fortie thousand
men in them, and one made generall ouer them all, a gentle
man called Omoncon, for to go seeke and followe this rouer,
with expresse commandement to apprehende or kill him,
although to the executing of the same he put both shippes
and men in danger.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote">They do more esteeme honor than
losse of ships or men.</span>
Of all this prouision, Lymahon had aduertisement by some
secrete friends, who seeing that his enemies were many, and
he not able to counteruaile them, neither in shippes nor
men, determined not to abide the comming, but to retire and
depart from that coast: so in flying he came vnto an ilande
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_9" id="Page_ii_9">[9]</a></span>
in secrete called Touznacaotican, which was fortie leagues
from the firme land, and is in the right way of nauigation to
the Ilands Philippinas.</p>

<p>In this iland was Lymahon retyred with his armie a certaine
time, and durst not returne to the firme land, for that
he knew that the kinges fleete did lie vpon the coast to
defende the same. And although he did send foorth some
ships a robbing, yet did they not doo any thing of importance,
but rather came flying away from the mightie power
of the kinges. From this ilande they did goe foorth with
some of their ships, robbing and spoyling al such as they met
with marchandice and other things that they carried from
one ilande to an other, and from the iland vnto the firme,
and comming from thence amongst them all, they caused to
take two ships of China which came from Manilla, and were
bound to their owne countrie. And hauing them in their
power they searched them vnder hatches, and found that
they had rich things of golde, and Spanish ryalles, which
they had in truck of their marchandice the which they carried
to the ilandes. They informed themselues in all points
of the state and fertilitie of that countrie, but in particular of
the Spaniardes, and how many there were of them in the
citie of Manilla, who were not at that present aboue seuentie
persons, for that the rest were separated in the discouering
and populing of other ilands newly found; and vnderstanding
that these few did liue without any suspition of enimies,
and had neuer a fort nor bulwarke, and the ordinance which
they had (although it was very good), yet was it not in order
to defend themselues nor offend their enemies, hee determined
to goe thither with all his fleete and people, for to
destroy and kill them, and to make himselfe lorde of the
saide ilande of Manilla and other adiacent there nigh the
same. And there he thought himselfe to be in securitie
from the power of the king, which went seeking of him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_10" id="Page_ii_10">[10]</a></span>
And so, as he was determined, he put it in vre<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with as much
expedition as was possible.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>This rouer Limahon goeth to the Ilands Philippinas, and commeth to

<p>This rouer Limahon determining to goe and to take the
Ilands Philippinas, and to make himselfe lord and king ouer
them all, but first to kill the Spaniardes, which hee thought
easely to be done, for that there was so few. And there he
pretended to liue in securitie, without feare that before he
had of the kings great fleete, for that it was so farre distant
from the firme lande. So with this determination hee departed
from those ilandes whereas he was retyred, and went
to sea, and sayling towardes the Ilandes Philippinas they
passed in sight of the Ilandes of the Illocos, which had a
towne called Fernandina,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which was newe founded by the
captaine John de Salzedo, who at that instant was in the
same for lieutenant to the gouernour. Foure leagues from
the same they met with a small galley, which the said John
de Salzedo had sent for victuals. There was in her but 25
souldiers besides y<sup>e</sup> rouers, so that with the one and the
other they were but a fewe in number; for that as they
thought they did trauaile in places of great securitie, and
without any suspition to meete enemies. So soone as Limahon
had discouered the galley, hee cast about towardes her,
and with great ease did take her, and did burne and kill all
that was in her, and pardoned one of them.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The Illocos, Ilocos, Ylocos, or Hilocos, here erroneously called

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_11" id="Page_ii_11">[11]</a></span></p></div>

<p>This being done, he did prosecute his voyage according
vnto his determination, and passed alongest, but not in such
secret but that hee was discouered by the dwellers of the
towne of Fernandina, who gaue notice thereof vnto the
lieutenant of the gouernor aforesaide, as a woonder to see so
many shippes together, and a thing neuer seene before at
those ilands. Likewise it caused admiration vnto him, and
made him to thinke and to imagine with great care what it
might bee; hee sawe that they did beare with the citie of
Manilla, and thought with himselfe, that so great a fleete as
that was could not goe to the place which they bare in with,
for any goodnesse towardes the dwellers therein, who were
voide of all care, and a small number of people as aforesaid.
Wherewith hee determined with himselfe with so great
speede as it was possible, to ioyne togither such Spaniards as
were there, which were to y<sup>e</sup> number of fiftie foure, and to
depart and procure (although they did put themselues in
danger of inconuenience) to get the forehande of them, to
aduertise them of Manilla, and to ayde and helpe them to
put their artilerie in order, and all other thinges necessarie
for their defence.</p>

<p>This determination the captayne did put in vse verie
speedily, which was the occasion that the citie and all those
that were in it was not destroyed and slayne: yet they could
not eschue all the harme, for that the shippes that carried
them were small, and a few rouers and not very expert, for
that the suddennesse of their departure would not afforde
better choice, as also they went from one place to an other
procuring of victuals: all which was the occasion that they
did not come thither in such time as they desired, and as was
conuenient.</p>

<p>This Lymahon was well prouided of prouision and al
other thinges necessarie, and hauing the wind fayre, he was
alwaies in the fore front, and came in the sight of Manilla
vppon Saint Andros Eue, in the yeare 1574, whereas he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_12" id="Page_ii_12">[12]</a></span>
came to an anker that night with all his whole fleete. And
he seeing that the end of his pretence consisted in expedition
before that they should be seene of those of the citie, or discouered
by them on the coasts: the nightes at that time
being very darke, which was a great helpe vnto them, he
chose foure hundred of his best souldiers, such as hee was
fully perswaded of their valour and stout courage, and put
them in small vessels, and charged those that went with them
for captaines, to make such expedition that they might come
vnto the citie before it was day; and the first thing that they
did was to set fire on the citie, and not to let escape one man
liuing therein, promising them that at the break of the day
he would be with them to giue them aide and succour if
neede did require, which they did. But for that nothing
is done without the will and permission of God, it went not
with Limahon and his foure hundred souldiers according as
he did make reckoning; for that all that night the winde
was of the shoore, and the more the night came on, the more
the wind encreased, which was such a contradiction vnto
their expectation, that they could not by night disembarke
themselues, although they did procure by all meanes possible
by policie and force for to do it. Which of certaintie and
without all doubt, if this had not beene (at great ease), they
had brought to a conclusion their euill pretence, with the
spoyle and losse of the citie and all that dwelt therein: for
their pretence was for to destroy and beat it downe, as it
might well appeare by the commandement hee gaue vnto his
captaines.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Limahon doth send 400 souldiers before for to burne the citie of
Manilla, and they were resisted by other men.</i></p></div>


<p>For all the contradiction of the winde this same night, the
foure hundred Chinos did put themselues within a league of
the citie, vpon S. Andrewes day, at eight of the clocke in
the morning, whereas they left their boates and went a land,
and in great haste beganne to march forwardes in battaile
a raye deuided in two partes, with two hundred hargabuses
afore, and immediatly after them other two hundred pickemen:
and by reason that they were manie and the countrie
verie plaine, they were straightwayes discouered by some of
the citie, who entered in with a great noyse, crying, Arme,
arme, arme, the enemies come! The which aduice did little
profite, for that there was none that would beleeue them:
but beleeued that it was some false larum doone by the
people of the countrie for to mocke them. But in conclusion
the enemies were come vnto the house of the generall of
the fielde, who was called Martin de Goyti, which was the
first house in all the citie that wayes which the enemies
came. And before that the Spaniardes and souldiers that
were within the towne could bee fully perswaded the rumour
to be true, the enemies had set fire vpon his house, and slewe
him and all that were within, that none escaped but onely
the goodwife of the house, whom they left naked and verie
sore wounded, beleeuing that she had beene dead: but afterwards
shee recouered and was healed of her woundes. In
the meane time that they were occupied in their first crueltie,
they of the citie were fully resolued of the trueth, although
all of them, with this successe unlooked for, were as people
amased and from themselues; yet in the end they sounded
to armour, and did provide to saue their liues. Some souldiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_14" id="Page_ii_14">[14]</a></span>
went foorth vppon the sandes, but in ill order as the
time did permitte, and slewe all the Chinos that they did
meete, and none escaped: which was the occasion that the
rest did ioyne themselues together, and put themselues in
order to make some resistance against their enemies, who
with great furie entred into the citie, burning and destroying
all before them, and crying victorie.</p>


<p>This is the proper resistance of the Spaniardes when they
doo finde themselues in such like perilles: and this was
<span class="sidenote">A good praise of others.</span>
doone with such great courage, that it was sufficient to stay
the furie of those which vnto that time had the victorie:
and to make them to retyre, although there was great difference
in number betwixt the one and the other.</p>

<p>The Chinos in retyring lost some of their souldiers, but
vnto the Spaniardes no great harme, and in this their defence
did notable actes. This being considered of the Chinos,
and that their boates were farre off, for that time would not
giue them place to bring them any nearer, they did resolue
themselues to leaue assault in the state that it was in, and
put themselues in couert, and there to refresh themselues
of the trauaile past, and afterwarde to returne with their
generall Captaine Lymahon, to prosecute their intent, which
they thought to bee comprehended with great ease. So
when they came vnto their boates, to avoyde any danger
that might happen, they embarked themselues and returned
vnto their fleete whereas they left them. And not long after
they were departed, they might see them rowe with great
furie towardes their shippes, and when they came vnto their
captaine Limahon, they did aduertise him in particular of
all that had happened, and how that by reason of the contrarie
winde, they could not come thether in time as he had
commanded them, and according vnto their desire, which
was the occasion that they could not bring to passe their
pretence, and that by reason of his absence they had referred
it till a better occasion did serue. Their captaine did comfort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_15" id="Page_ii_15">[15]</a></span>
them, and gaue them great thankes, for that which they
had done, promising them in short time to bring to effect
their euill intent; and straightway commanded to weigh
anker, and to enter into a port called Cabile, which is but
two leagues from the citie of Manilla. Thither they of the
citie might plainely see them to enter.</p>

planted himselfe vppon the plaine nigh the riuer Pagansinan.</i></p></div>


<p>At this time, by the order of his majestie, was elected for
gouernour of these Ilandes Philippinas, Guido de Labacares,
after the death of Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, who understanding
the great fleete and power of Lymahon the rover,
and the small resistance and defence that was in the citie of
Manilla, with as much speede as was possible he did call
together all their captaynes and dwellers therein: and with
a generall consent they did determine to make some defence
for to resist them as well as they could (for the time that the
enemie did remaine in the port aforesaide): for to the contrarie
the Spaniardes should loose great credite, if that they
should forsake and leaue the towne, so long as their liues
did indure. For in no other place in all the ilandes there
about, they could haue any securitie. With this determination
they put this worke in execution, and spared no person,
of what qualitie and degree so euer he was, but that his
hande was to helpe all that was possible, the which indured
two dayes and two nightes, for so long the rouer kept his
shippes and came not abrode: for these woorthie souldiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_16" id="Page_ii_16">[16]</a></span>
vnderstoode, that remayning with their liues their labour
and trauaile would soone be eased.</p>

<p>In which time of their continuall labour, they made a fort
with pipes and bordes filled with sande and other necessaries
thereto belonging, such as the time would permit
them: they put in carriages foure excellent peeces of artilerie
that were in the citie. All the which being put in order,
they gathered together all the people of the citie into that
little fort, which they made by the prouidence of God our
Lorde, as you may beleeue, for that it was not his pleasure
that so many soules as were in those ilands, baptised and
sealed with the light and knowledge of his holy faith, should
returne againe to be ouercome with the deuill: out of whose
power hee brought them by his infinite goodness and mercie:
neither would hee that the friendship should be lost that
these ilands had with the mightie kingdome of China. By
which meanes we may coniecture that the diuine power had
ordained the remedie of saluation for all that countrie. The
night before the enemie did giue assault vnto the citie, came
thether the captayne John de Salzedo, lieutenant vnto the
gouernour of the townes of Fernandina, who, as aforesayde,
came with purpose to ayde and helpe the Spaniardes that
were then in Manilla. Whose comming, without all doubt,
with his companions, was the principall remedie, as well
vnto the citie, as vnto all those that were within it: for considering
that they were but fewe, and the great paines they
tooke in making the last resistance, and the labor and trauaile
they had in the ordayning of the fort for their defence, with
other necessaries, against that which was to come, ioyning
therewith the feare that was amongst them of the assalt past:
surely they had neede of such a succour as this was: and
surely by the opinion of all men, it was a myracle of God,
doone to bring them thether. So with the comming of this
captaine with his people, they all recouered newe courage,
with great hope valiantly to resist their enemies: for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_17" id="Page_ii_17">[17]</a></span>
which incontinent they did put all thinges in good order,
for that the rouer the morning following, before the breake
of the day (which was the second day after hee gaue the
first assalt), was with all his fleete right against the port, and
did put a lande sixe hundreth souldiers, who at that instant
did set vppon the citie, the which at their pleasure they did
sacke and burne (for that it was left alone without people, as
aforesayde by the order and commaundement of the gouernour,
which for their more securitie were retyred into the fort).</p>

<p>So hauing fired the citie, they did assalt the fort with
great crueltie, as men fleshed with the last slaughter, thinking
that their resistance was but small. But it fell not
out as they did beleeue, for that all those that were within
were of so valiant courage, that who so euer of their enemies
that were so bolde as to enter into their fort, did paye for
their boldnesse with the losse of their liues. Which being
seene by the Chinos they did retire, hauing continued in the
fight almost all the day, with the losse of two hundreth men,
that were slaine in the assalt, and many other hurt; and of
the Spaniardes were slaine but onely two, the one was the
Ancient bearer, called Samho<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Hortiz, and the other was the
bayliefe of the citie, called Francisco de Leon. All which
being considered by Lymahon the rouer, who being politike
and wise, and saw that it was losse of time and men, to goe
forwardes with his pretence against the valiauntnesse of the
Spaniardes (which was cleane contrarie vnto that which had
proued vnto that day), he thought it the best way to embarke
himselfe and to set sayle, and goe vnto the porte of Cabite
from whence he came. But first hee gathered together all
his dead people, and after did burie them at the ilande aforesaid,
where as he stayed two dayes for the same purpose.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_3" id="Footnote_1_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Misspelt for Sancho.</p></div>

<p>That being doone, he straightwayes departed from thence
and returned the same way that he came, till he ariued in a
mightie riuer, fortie leagues from the citie of Manilla, that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_18" id="Page_ii_18">[18]</a></span>
called Pangasinan, the which place or soyle did like him
verie well, and where he thought he might be sure from
them, who by the commaundement of the king went for to
seeke him.</p>

<p>There hee determined to remayne, and to make him selfe
lorde ouer all that countrie, the which hee did with little
trauaile, and built himselfe a fort one league within the
ryuer, where as he remayned certayne dayes, receauing
tribute of the inhabitants there abouts, as though he were
their true and naturall lorde: and at times went foorth with
his ships, robbing and spoyling all that he met vpon the
coast. And spred abroade that hee had taken to him selfe
the Ilandes Philippinas, and howe that all the Spaniardes
that were in them, were eyther slaine or fledde away: wherewith
hee put all cities and townes bordering there aboutes in
great feare, and also how that he had setled himselfe upon this
mightie riuer Pangasinan, whereas they did receiue him for
their lord, and so they did obey him, and paide him tribute.</p>

<p>The gouernour vnderstanding by the ilanders, and of those
that dwelt in the citie of Manilla, of the fame that the rouer
Limahon did publish abroad in all places where as he went,
howe that he had ouerthrowen and slaine the Spaniardes;
and being of them well considered, that if in time they did
not preuent the same, it might be the occasion of some great
euill, that afterwardes they should not so easely remedie as
presently they might: and those which were their friendes
and subiectes in all those ilandes, giuing credite vnto that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_19" id="Page_ii_19">[19]</a></span>
which the rouer declared, might be an occasion that they
should rebell against them, by reason that the naturall people
were many and they but a few: for that vnto that time they
had sustained themselues onely by the fame to be inuincible.
With this consideration they entred into counsell, and did
determine to ioyne together all the people they could, and
being in good order, to follow and seeke the rouer, for that
they vnderstood of necessitie he must abide and repayre
himself in some place nigh there aboutes, for that he durst
not goe vnto China for feare that he had of the kings fleete;
and fearing that they should vse such policies as hee hath
vsed, they might come on him unwares, and destroy him as
he had done others. And seeming vnto them (that although
they could not destroy him altogether) yet at the least they
should be reuenged of the harme that they had receiued, and
thereby to giue to vnderstand that the fame that he hath
giuen out of himselfe was a lie, and should be an occasion
for to remaine in their old securitie, and also had in better
estimation and opinion of the dwellers there abouts, as also
to cause great friendship with the King of China, for that it
is against a traytor and one that hath offended him.</p>

<p>This determination they put in vre and effect according as
the time would permit: in which time they had certaine
newes howe that the rouer was in the river of Pagansinan,
and there did pretende to remaine. These newes were very
ioyfull vnto the Spaniardes. Then the gouernours commanded
to be called together all people bordering there
abouts, and to come vnto the citie where as hee was. Likewise
at that time he did giue aduice vnto such as were
lordes and gouernours of the ilandes called Pintados,<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> commanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_20" id="Page_ii_20">[20]</a></span>
them to come thither, with such shippes and people
as they could spare, as well Spaniardes as the naturall people
of the countrie. All this was accomplished and done with
great speede; the people of the countrie came thither with
great good will, but in especiall those of the ilandes of the
Pintados. After the death of Martin de Goyti, who was slaine
in the first assault of the Chinos as aforesayde in the citie of
Manilla, the governour did ordaine in his roome for generall
of the field, in the name of his maiestie, John de Salzedo,
who with all this people, and with those that were in the
citie, went foorth (leauing the gouvernor no more ayde then
that which was sufficient for the defence of the citie and
the fort that they had new made, which was verie strong),
and carried in his company two hundred and fifty Spanish
souldiers, and two thousand five hundred Indians their
friends. All which went with great good will and courage
to be revenged on the iniurie receiued, or to die in the
quarrell. All which people were embarked in small ships
and two foygattes<a name="FNanchor_2_5" id="FNanchor_2_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that came from the ilandes there borderers,
for that the shortnes of time would not permit them to prouide
bigger shipping, neyther should they haue found them
as they would, for at such time as the inhabitants therabouts
did see the rouer in assalt against the citie, they did set fire
on a small galley and other bigge ships that were in the same
port, and did rise against the Spaniards, beleeuing that it
had not been possible for them to escape so great and mightie
a power: although since the first entrie of the Spaniardes in
those ilandes they were verie subiect. The generall of the
fielde with the people aforesaide, did depart from Manilla
the three and twentieth day of March anno 1575, and arrived
at the mouth of the river Pagansinan vpon tenable<a name="FNanchor_3_6" id="FNanchor_3_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Wednesday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_21" id="Page_ii_21">[21]</a></span>
in the morning next following, without being discouered
of any, for that it was doone with great aduice, as a thing
that did import verie much. Then straightwaies at that
instant the generall did put a lande all his people and foure
peeces of artilerie, leauing the mouth of the riuer shutte vp
with his shipping, inchayning the one to the other, in such
sort that none could enter in, neyther yet goe foorth to give
anie aduice vnto the rouer of his ariuall: hee commaunded
some to goe and discouer the fleete of the enimie, and the
place whereas hee was fortified, and charged them verie much
to doo it in such secrete sort that they were not espied, for
therein consisted all their whole worke. The captaines did
as they were commanded, and found the rouer voyde of all
care or suspition to receiue there any harme, as he found
them in the citie of Manilla when he did assault them.</p>

<p>This securitie that hee thought himselfe in did proceede
from the newes that hee had from his friendes at the China,
that although they did prouide to sende against him, yet
could they not so quickly haue any knowledge where hee
was, neyther finde out the place of his abiding: and againe,
hee knewe that the Spaniards of the Phillippinas remained
without shippes, for that they had burnt them as you haue
heard, and that they had more need to repayre themselues
of their ill intreatie the yeare past, then to seeke any reuengement
of their iniuries receiued.</p>

<p>The generall of the fielde being fully satisfied of his negligence
and voide of care, and giuen to vnderstande of the
secretest way that was to goe vnto the fort whereas the rouer
was, he commaunded the captayne Gabriell de Ribera that
straightwayes he should depart by lande, and that vppon a
suddaine, he should strike alarum vpon the enimie, with the
greatest tumult that was possible. Likewise he commanded
the captaynes Pedro de Caues<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and Lorenso Chacon, that
either of them with fortie souldiers should goe vp the riuer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_22" id="Page_ii_22">[22]</a></span>
in small shippes and light, and to measure the time in such
sort, that as well those that went by lande, as those that went
by water, should at one instant come vppon the fort, and to
give alarum both together, the better to goe thorough with
their pretence: and he himselfe did remaine with all the rest
of the people to watch occasion and time for to ayde and
succour them if neede required. This their purpose came
so well to passe, that both the one and the other came to
good effect: for those that went by water did set fire on all
the fleete of the enemie, and those that went by lande at that
instant had taken and set fire on a trench made of tymber, that
Lymahon had caused to be made for the defence of his people
and the fort: and with that furie they slewe more then one
hundreth Chinos, and tooke prisoners seuentie women which
they founde in the same trench; but when that Lymahon
vnderstoode the rumour, he tooke himselfe straightwayes to
his fort, which he had made for to defend himselfe from the
kinges navie, if they should happen to finde him out: and
there to saue his life vpon that extremitie, he commaunded
some of his souldiers to goe foorth and to skirmish with the
Spaniardes, who were verie wearie with the trauaile of all
that day, and with the anguish of the great heate, with the
burning of the ships and the trench, which was intollerable,
for that they all burned together.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_7" id="Footnote_1_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Chabes in original.</p></div>

<p>The captaines seeing this, and that their people were out
of order, neither could they bring them into any, for that
they were also weary (although the generall of the field did
succour them in time, the which did profite them much), yet
did they sound a retraite, and did withdraw themselues with
the losse of fiue Spaniards and thirtie of the Indians their
friends, and neuer a one more hurt. Then the next day
following the generall of the fielde did bring his souldiers
into a square battle, and began to march towards the fort,
with courage to assalt it if occasion did serve thereunto: he
did pitch his campe within two hundreth paces of the fort,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_23" id="Page_ii_23">[23]</a></span>
and founde that the enimie did all that night fortifie himselfe
verie well, and in such sort that it was perilous to assalt him,
for that he had placed vpon his fort three peeces of artilerie,
and many bases,<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> besides other ingins of fire worke. Seeing
this, and that his peeces of artilerie that hee brought were
very small for to batter, and little store of munition, for that
they had spent all at the assalt which the rouer did giue
them at Manilla, the generall of the fielde and the captaines
concluded amongst themselues, that seeing the enimie had
no ships to escape by water, neither had hee any great store
of victuals, for that all was burnt in the ships, it was the best
and most surest way to besiege the fort, and to remaine there
in quiet vntill that hunger did constraine them either to
yeeld or come to some conclusion, which rather they will
then to perish with hunger.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_8" id="Footnote_1_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> In the original Spanish <i>versete</i>. A "base" was the smallest piece of
ordnance made.</p>

<p>This determination was liked well of them all, although
it fell out cleane contrarie vnto their expectation; for that
in the space of three monethes that siege indured, this Limahon
did so much that within the fort he made certaine
small barkes, and trimmed them in the best manner he
coulde, wherewith in one night hee and all his people escaped,
as shall bee tolde you: a thing that seemed impossible,
and caused great admiration amongst the Spaniards, and
more for that his departure was such that he was not discouered,
neither by them on the water nor on the lande.
What happened in these three monethes, I doo not here
declare, although some attempts were notable, for that my
intent is to declare what was the occasion that those religious
men and their consorts did enter into the kingdome of China,
and to declare of that which they said they had seene: for
the which I haue made relation of the comming of Limahon,
and of all the rest which you haue heard.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Omoncon, captain of the king of China, commeth to seeke Limahon,
and doth meete with Spaniards.</i></p></div>


<p>In the meane time that the siege indured at the fort, as
you haue vnderstood, there went and came certaine vessels
which brought victuals and other necessaries from the cittie
of Manilla, which was but fortie leagues from the mouth of
that riuer of Pagansinan, as hath beene tolde you. It happened
vppon a day that a shippe of Myguel de Loarcha,
wherein was frier Martin de Herrada, provinciall of the
Augustine friers, who was come vnto the riuer Pagansinan
for to see the generall of the fielde, and in the same shippe
returned vnto Manilla to hold Capitulo, or court, in the saide
ilande and port of Buliano. Seuen leagues after they were
out of the mouth of Pagansinan, they met with a shippe of
Sangleyes, who made for the port, and thinking them to bee
enimies, they bore with them (hauing another shippe that
followed them for their defence), and had no more in them
but the saide prouinciall and fiue Spanyards, besides the
mariners. This shippe of Sangley, seeing that hee did beare
with them, would haue fledde, but the winde woulde not
permit him, for that it was to him contrarie; which was the
occasion that the two shippes wherein the Spanyards were,
for that they did both saile and rowe, in a small time came
within cannon shot. In one of the shippes there was a Chino
called Sinsay, one who had beene many times at Manilla
with merchandise, and was a verie friend and knowne of the
Spanyards, and vnderstoode their language; who knowing
that shippe to be of China, and not to be a rouer, did request
our people not to shoote, neither to doo them any
harme, vntill such time as they were informed what they
were in that same shippe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_25" id="Page_ii_25">[25]</a></span></p>


<p>This Sinsay went straight wayes into the fore shippes, and
demanded what they were, and from whence they came: and
being well informed, he vnderstoode that he was one of the
ships of warre that was sent out by the king of China,
to seeke the rouer Limahon, who leauing the rest of the
fleet behinde, came forth to seeke in those ilands to see if he
coulde discouer him to be any of them: and the better to be
informed thereof, they were bounde into the port of Buliano,
from whence they came with their two shippes: from whome
they woulde haue fledde, thinking they had beene some of
the rouers shippes. Being fully perswaded the one of the
other, they ioyned together with great peace and friendshippe:
<span class="sidenote">The captaine generall of the king of China.</span>
the Spanyards straightwayes entred into their boate
and went vnto the shippe of the Chinos, and carried with
them the aforesaid Sinsay for to be their interpreter, and to
speake vnto the Chinos. In the saide shippe came a man of
great authoritie who was called Omoncon, who brought a
commission from their king, and shewed it vnto the Spanyards
and vnto the father prouinciall: in the which the king
and his councell did pardon all those souldiers that were
with Limahon, if that forthwith they would leaue him and
returne vnto the kings part; and likewise did promise great
gifts and fauour vnto him that did either take or kill the
aforesaid rouer. Then did Sinsay declare vnto him of the
comming of the rouer vnto the ilands, and all that happened
in the siege of the cittie, as aforesaide: and howe they had
him besieged in the riuer of Pagansinan, from whence it was
not possible for him to escape.</p>

<p>The captain Omoncon reioyced very much of these newes,
and made many signes of great content, and did embrace the
Spanyards many times, and gaue other tokens whereby he
did manifest the great pleasure he receiued, and woulde
therewith straightwaies depart vnto the rest of the fleet. And
for that they looked euery day for the death or imprisonment
of the rouer, the better to informe himselfe, hee determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_26" id="Page_ii_26">[26]</a></span>
(for it was so nigh hand) to go and see the generall
of the fielde in Pagansinan, and carry with him Sinsay, one
that was knowne both of the one and the other: by whose
meanes they might treate of such things that best accomplished
the confirmation of the peace and friendship betwixt
the Chinos and the Spaniards, as also of the death or imprisonment
of Limahon. With this resolution the one departed
vnto Pagansinan, whereas they arriued the same day,
and the others vnto Manilla, whether they went for victuals.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Omoncon is well received of the generall of the field, and lodged in
Manilla with the gouernor, whereas they doo conclude the going of
the fathers of Saint Augustine to China.</i></p></div>


<p>When that the generall of the field vnderstood wherfore
the comming of Omoncon was, hee did entertaine him with
great curtesie; and after that hee had giuen him to vnderstand
in what extremitie he had brought the rouer (which
was a thing impossible for him to escape, except it were
with wings), hee did counsell him, that for the time till hee
brought his purpose to effect (which could not be long) that
he would go vnto Manilla, which was not farre from thence,
and there to recreate and sport himselfe with the gouernor
and other Spaniards that were there, for that hee alone was
sufficient to accomplish his pretence, without the comming
thither of the kings fleete, neither for to remoue out of the
port whereas they were in securitie. And for his going
thither he should haue a shippe of his the which did row,
and was for to bring victuals and other prouision; and he
shoulde go in the company of the captaine Pedro de Chaues
that was bound vnto Manilla, and promised him that within
few dayes he would giue him the rouer aliue or deade,
which vnto the iudgement of all men coulde not bee long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_27" id="Page_ii_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<p>Omoncon, considering that this offer might come well to
passe, did put it straight wayes in vre, and did imbarke
himselfe in the company of y<sup>e</sup> captain, and sent his ship
wherein he came alone by sea, because it was big and drew
much water: the which was constrained to turne backe
againe into the part from whence he went, by reason of
stormie windes and wether, and was no impediment in the
other with ores, for that hee went alongst the shoare and
was shrowded with the land from the force of the wind, so
that in few dayes they arriued in the port of the cittie of
Manilla, whereas they were well receiued and feasted of the
gouernor. Omoncon remained ther certaine dayes, after the
which, he seeing that the siege did long endure, and that
his staying might cause suspition of his death; and againe,
that the whole fleete did tarrie his comming to his intelligence
of the rouer, being fully perswaded and certaine that
hee coulde not escape the Spaniards hand, they had him in
such a straight, and that they would without all doubt sende
him vnto the king aliue or dead (as they promised him), hee
was determined to returne vnto China with the good newes
that he had vnderstood, with a determinate intent, to returne
againe and carrie the rouer after that they had him prisoner.
With this resolution, in the end of certaine dayes, he went
vnto the gouernor, certifying him of his pretence, whereby
he might giue him license to put it in execution. The
gouernor did like wel of his pretence, and did promise him
the same the which the generall of the fielde did offer vnto
him: and which was, so soone as the rouer should be taken
prisoner or slaine, to sende him vnto the king without any
delay, or else to put him whereas he should be foorth comming,
and to giue them aduertisement to send for him, or
come himself: and did offer him, more, that for his voyage
he should be prouided forthwith of all things necessarie,
without lacking of anything. Omoncon did give him great
thankes for the same, and in recompence therof did promise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_28" id="Page_ii_28">[28]</a></span>
vnto the gouernor, for that he understoode and had intelligence
of the fathers of S. Augustine, that his honor, and his
antecessor and the Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legaspi,
had desired many times to send vnto the kingdome of China
some religious men, to intreat of the preaching of the gospel,
and to see the wonders of that kingdome, and howe that they
neuer coulde put this their desire in execution; for that
those Chinos which came thither, although they did offer
them whatsoeuer they would demand, fearing the punishment
that should be executed on them according vnto the
<span class="sidenote">Omoncon promiseth to carry the
friers vnto China.</span>
lawes of the kingdome: he did promise him that he would
carrie them with him vnto China, such religious men as his
honour would command, and some souldiers such as would
go with them: hoping with the good newes that hee carried,
to runne in no daunger of the law, neither the vizroy of
Aucheo to thinke euill thereof; and for a more securitie that
they should not be euill intreated, hee woulde leaue with
him pledges to their content.</p>



<p>The gouernor reioyced verie much at this his offer, for
that it was the thing that he and all those of the ilands most
desired of long time since, and did straightwayes accept his
offer; saying that he did clearely discharge him of his
pledges, for that he was fully satisfied of his valor and worthines,
and that hee would not doo the thing that should
not be decent vnto his person and office. The gouernor
being verie ioyful of these newes, did therewith sende for
the prouinciall of the Augustine friers, who was elected but
fewe dayes past: his name was frier Alonso de Alvarado, a
man of a sincere life, and one of them that was sent by the
emperor in the discouerie of the newe Guinea, vnto whome
hee declared the offer that the captaine Omoncon had made
vnto him: whereat he reioyced so much, that being an old
man, hee would himself haue gone thither: to which the
gouernor would not consent in respect of his age, and other
particularities, but entred in counsel who were best to go,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_29" id="Page_ii_29">[29]</a></span>
and to finde one that were fitte to execute that which they
<span class="sidenote">A good pretence.</span>
had pretended (which was, as wee haue saide, to bring in
and plant in that kingdome the holie Catholike faith): they
determined that there shoulde go but two religious men, by
reason that at that time there was but a fewe of them, and
<span class="sidenote">The friers names that went to China.</span>
two souldiers in their companie. The religious men shoulde
bee frier Martin de Herrada of Pamplona, who left off the
dignitie of prouinciall, and was a man of great learning and
of a holy life: and for the same effect had learned the China
tongue, and manie times for to put his desire in execution
did offer himselfe to bee slaue vnto the merchants of China,
onely for to carrie him thither: and in companie with him
should go frier Hieronimo Martin, who also was verie well
learned, and of the cittie of Mexico. The souldiers that were
appointed to beare them companie, were called Pedro Sarmiento,
chiefe sargeant of the cittie of Manilla, of Vilorado;
and Miguel de Loarcha, both principall men and good
Christians, as was conuenient for that which they tooke in
hand. These fathers did carrie them for this purpose, that
if they did remaine there with the king preaching of the
gospell, then they shoulde returne with the newes thereof
to giue the gouernour to vnderstande of all that they had
seene and happened vnto them; and likewise vnto the king
of Spaine, if neede did so require.</p>


<p>This offer of the captaine Omoncon, and the appointment
which was made by the gouernour and the prouinciall, was
knowne throughout al the citie; and after that they had
made great reioycings and feasts for the same, it was approued
of all men, that those that were named were principall
persons, as aforesaid, and were fully certified that there
should nothing be neglected of that they did commaunde
them: neither let passe any occasion, for that it was that
which they did all desire, but in particular for the seruice
and honor of God, and for the benefite and profite that
shoulde redowne vnto them all by the mutuall contractation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_30" id="Page_ii_30">[30]</a></span>
betwixt the one nation and the other: and also giue the
king to vnderstande of so good newes as this is. The
gouernor did straightwayes call those persons that were
named and appointed to come before the captain Omoncon,
and tolde them what was determined: the which they did
accept with great ioy, and gaue great thankes; and the
gouernor in token of gratitude, did giue vnto the captaine
Omoncon, in the presence of them all, a gallant chaine of
golde, and a rich robe of crimson in graine: a thing that
<span class="sidenote">A token that fine cloth is esteemed.</span>
hee esteemed verie much, and much more esteemed in
China, for that it is a thing that they haue not there. Besides
this, they did ordaine a reasonable present for to sende
vnto the gouernor of Chincheo, he that dispatched Omoncon
by the commandement of the king to go and seek the rouer:
also another present for the vizroy of the prouince of Ochian,
who was at that present in the citie of Aucheo.</p>

<p>And for that Sinsay shoulde not finde himselfe agreeued
(who was a merchant well knowne amongst them, and perhappes
might bee the occasion of some euill and disturbance
of their pretence), they gaue vnto him also another chaine of
golde, as well for this, as also for that hee was euer a sure
and perfite friend vnto the Spaniards. Then straightwayes
by the commaundement of the gouernor, there were brought
togither all such Chinos as were captiue and taken from
Limahon out of the fort aforesaide at Pagansinan, and gaue
them vnto Omoncon to carrie them free with him; and gaue
likewise commaundement that the generall of the fielde, and
all such captaines and souldiers that were at the siege of the
forte, shoulde giue vnto him all such as did there remaine;
binding himselfe to pay vnto the souldiers, to whome they did
appertaine, all whatsoeuer they should be valued to be
worth: all the which being done, he commanded to bee put
in a redinesse all that was necessarie for the voyage, and
that in ample manner, the which was doone in a short time.</p>

<p>The twelfth day of June, in the yeare of our Lord 1575,
being Sunday in the morning, the aforesaid gouernor and all
that were in the cittie did ioyne and go together vnto the
monasterie of saint Augustine, where was deuout prayers
made vnto the Holy Ghost, and after they had all of them
requested of God so to direct the voyage, that it might be
to the honor and glorie of his diuine majestie, and to the
saluation of the soules of that kingdome, whome Lucyfer had
so long possessed, Omoncon and Sinsay did take their leaue
of the gouernour, and of the rest, giuing them thankes for
their good entertainment that they made them, and did
promise them, in recompence thereof, to bee alwayes their
assured friends, as shall appeare by his works, and to carry
them, whome he did request of his owne good will, with
securitie as vnto himselfe, and that he would first suffer
wrong himselfe, before any should be done vnto those whom
he had on his charge. The gouernor and all the rest did
thankfully accept his new offer, giuing him to vnderstand
that they were fully perswaded that his word and deede
should be all one, and therewith they tooke their leaue of
them, and of the religious men with the two souldiers their
companions, not lacking teares to be shed on both parts.</p>

<p>Then did they al imbarke themselues in a ship of the
ilands which was made readie for the same effect, and went
out of the port in the company of another shippe with merchants
of China that were at Manilla, into the which Sinsay
put himselfe with all their victuals, for to carry it vntill they
came vnto the port of Buliano, whereas was the great shippe
of Omoncon, wherin they should make their voyage; which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_32" id="Page_ii_32">[32]</a></span>
was that which was forced to returne backe againe by reason
of foule wether: they aryued at the same port the Sunday
following, for that the winde was somewhat contrarie, and
had lost the shippe that carried their victuals, but after
founde her at an anker in the port, for that she was the
bigger shippe and sailed better: they founde also in her two
Spanish souldiers, whom the generall of the fielde had sent
from Pagansinan, for that, from the place whereas he was, he
did see the saide ship to enter into the port, with commandement
for to carrie them vnto him. This did cause vnto the
religious men and souldiers a suspition that the generall of
the fielde woulde procure to stay them vntill such time as
he did see the ende of the siege of the fort, which euerie
day was looked when they would yeelde, for that they
shoulde carry with them Limahon the rouer aliue or dead.
Uppon the which almost euery one gaue his iudgement, that
it were better to depart without obeying his commandement,
neither to take their leave of him, but to prosecute their
voyage so much desired, for they thought euerie houre of
their staying to bee a whole yeare: fearing that euerie thing
would be an impediment to disturbe their intent and purpose:
but better persuading themselues, knowing the good
condition and great Christianitie of the generall of the fielde,
whom frier Martin had alwayes in place of his sonne, for
that he was the neuew vnto the Adelantado Legaspi, the first
gouernor and discouerer of the said Philippinas, whom he
brought with him from Mexico, being but a child: they
were agreed to go vnto him, and shewe their obedience,
and to take their leaue of him and of all the rest of their
friends that were in the camp. So with this determination
they put their shippe into the river Pagansinan, which was
but seuen leagues from the saide port. They had not sailed
three leagues but a contrary winde so charged them, that
they were constrained to returne into the port from whence
they came, and there concluded amongst themselues to send
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_33" id="Page_ii_33">[33]</a></span>
Pedro Sarmiento in the barke wherein came the two souldiers
aforesaid; for that it was little and went with oares, they
might with lesse daunger enter into the riuer of Pagansinan,
rowing vnder the shoore: and that hee in the name of them
all should conferre with the generall of the field, and so take
his leaue of him and of all the rest of their friends, whome
they did request that they would not forget them in their
prayers, to commend them vnto God to bee their aider and
helper in this their pretence, so much desired of them all:
and gave him great charge to bring with him the interpreter
that they should carrie with them, which was a boy of China
that was baptised in Manilla, and could speake Spanish very
well; he was named Gernando.<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This Pedro Sarmiento came
thither, and did accomplish all that was commended vnto him
verie faithfully: but the generall of the field was not therewith
satisfied, neither the captaines and souldiers that were
with him, for that the father friers were very wel beloued of
them, for they deserued it: so they determined to send for
them, and to request them to come thither and see them,
being so nigh as they were. They being vnderstood by the
friers (not without the suspition aforesaid), and seeing that
they could not excuse to go vnto them to accomplish their
commandement and gentle request, they departed out of
Buliano with a faire wind, for that the storme was done,
although the sea was a little troubled; and therewith they
ariued at Pagansinan whereas they were well receiued of the
generall of the fielde, and of all the rest with great ioy and
pleasure. Their suspition fell out cleane contrarie as they
thought, for that the generall of the fielde would not stay
them, but did dispatch them with all speede possible, and
did deliuer vnto them at the instant all such captiues as the
gouernor had commanded, and the souldiers that had them
did with a verie good will deliuer them, seeing to what intent
it did extende, and also the interpreter, with all other thinges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_34" id="Page_ii_34">[34]</a></span>
that was necessarie and requisite for the voyage; and writ a
letter vnto Omoncon, who remained in Buliano, that hee
would fauour and cherish them as he did not thinke to the
contrarie: and did ratifie that which the gouernour had promised
him, for to sende the rouer aliue or deade, after they
had ended their siege by one meanes or other. He also
requested of frier Martin de Herrada that he would carrie
with him one Nicholas de Cuenca, a souldier of his company,
for to buy for him certaine things in China, who did accept
the same with a verie good wil, and promised to intreat him
as one of his owne, and haue him in as great regard: and
therewith they departed and went vnto the port of Buliano
from whence they came, taking their leaue of the generall of
the field and of all the rest of the campe, with no lesse teares
then when they departed from Manilla. He sent to beare
them company til they came vnto the port, the sergeant
maior, who carried with him a letter vnto the captaine
Omoncon, and a present of victuals and other things; and
other two letters, the one for the gouernor of Chincheo, and
the other for the vizroy of the prouince of Ochian, wherein he
doth giue them to vnderstand how that he hath burnt al the
fleete of Limahon, and slaine many of his companions, and
howe that he hath besieged him so straightly that it is not
possible for him to escape, neither indure long without
yeelding of himselfe; and then either aliue or dead he would
send him, as the gouernor of Manilla had writ and promised.
These two letters were accompanied with two presents,
wherein was a basen and an ewre of siluer, and certaine
robes of Spanish cloth, the which the Chinos doo esteeme
very much, as also other things of great valew that they
have not in their country, and craving pardon because he
did not send more. The occasion was for that he was in
that place, and all his goods in the cittie of Manilla. The
same day with a faire winde they came vnto the port Buliano,
whereas they found Omoncon abiding their comming, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_35" id="Page_ii_35">[35]</a></span>
receiued all such things as the sergeant maior did carrie him
in the name of the generall of the field, and rendered vnto
him great thanks, and made a new promise to accomplish
that offer made vnto the gouernor.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniards do depart with the captain Omoncon from the port of
Buliano, and ariue at the firme lande of China.</i></p></div>


<p>The desire was so much of this father frier Martin de
Herrada to be in China, as well for to preach in it the holy
gospel, as also for to see the wonders that haue beene reported
to be in that countrie, that although he was dispatched by the
gouernor and generall of the fielde, yet he thought that their
voyage would be interrupted: and therefore to see himselfe
free from this feare and suspition, so soon as he came vnto
the port of Buliano to the captaine Omoncon, hee requested
him with great vehemencie, that he would straightwayes set
saile, for that the winde serued well for their purpose. Then
Omoncon, who desired no other thing, but thought euery
houre that he tarried to be a whole yeare, commanded forthwith
the mariners to make all thinges in a redinesse to set
saile, and to bring home all their ankers, and ride apicke,
redie to depart after midnight: the which was done as hee
had commanded. So vppon a Sunday at the break of day,
being 25. of June, they took a Spaniard souldier into their
<span class="sidenote">They departed towards China.</span>
companie, who was called John de Triana, and vsed him in
their seruice, for that hee was a mariner. So at the same
time, after they had praied vnto God to direct their voyage,
they set saile with a prosperous winde. There was with the
friers, souldiers, and men of seruice, twentie persons, besides
the Chinos that were captiues, and the people of the captaine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_36" id="Page_ii_36">[36]</a></span>
Omoncon. They were not so soone off from the coste, but
the winde abated and they remained becalmed certaine dayes:
but afterwards they had a lustie gale, that carried them forwards.
<span class="sidenote">Their compasses diuided into 12 partes.</span>
The Chinos doo gouerne their ships by a compasse
deuided into twelue partes, and doo vse no sea cardes, but a
briefe description of Ruter,<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> wherewith they doo nauigate or
saile: and commonly for the most part they neuer go out of
the sight of land. They maruelled very much when that it
was told them, that comming from Mexico vnto Philippinas,
they were three monethes at the sea and neuer sawe land.
So it pleased God, that although it was verie calme and little
winde stirring, that we made but little way, yet, upon the
Sunday following, which was the thirde of July, we had sight
of the land of China: so that we found all our voyage from
the port of Buliano, from whence we departed, vnto the
firme land, to be one hundred and fortie leagues; and
twenty leagues before they came in the sight thereof, they
had sounding at three score and tenne, and fourscore fathome,
and so waxed lesse and lesse vntill they came to the
lande, which is the best and surest token they haue to be
nigh the land. In all the time of their voyage, the captain
Omoncon with his companie shewed such great curtesie and
friendship to our men, as though they had been the owners
of the saide ship: and at such time as they did imbarke
themselues, he gaue his own cabin y<sup>t</sup> was in the sterne
to y<sup>e</sup> friers, and vnto Pedro Sarmiento and to Miguel de
Loarcha, he gaue another cabin that was very good, and
commanded his company in the ship that they should respect
them more then himselfe; the which was in such sort, that on
a day, at the beginning of their voyage, the fathers founde
them making of sacrifice vnto their idols, and told them that
all which they did was a kinde of mockage, and that they
shoulde worshipe but onely one God: and willed them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_37" id="Page_ii_37">[37]</a></span>
doe so no more. Who, onely in respect of them, did leaue
it off, and not vse it after in all the voyage: whereas before
they did vse it euerie day manie times.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_10" id="Footnote_1_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> More commonly spelt Rutter or Ruttier, a direction book. The word
is derived from "Routier," a road book.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">They leaue the worshiping of one
idol to worship another.</span>
Besides this, they would worshippe the images that the
friers did carrie with them, and kneele vpon their knees
with great shew of deuotion; who nowe hauing sight of the
firme lande in so short time, and passed that small gulfe so
quietly, which was wont to bee verie perilous and full of
stormes, they did attribute it vnto the orations of the friers,
their companions and souldiers. The like curtesie was
shewed vnto them by Sinsay, who was the seconde person
in the shippe, and hee that did best vnderstande that nauigation
and voyage. So, as they drewe nearer the land, they
might discouer from the sea a verie gallant and well towred
cittie, that was called Tituhul, whereas the king hath continually
in garrison tenne thousande souldiers, and is vnder
the gouernement of the prouince of Chincheo.</p>

<p>So the next day following wee came vnto a watch towre,
which was situated vppon a rocke at the entrie into a bay,
who had discouered our shippe, and knew the standart or
flagge to bee the kings: and made a signe vnto seuen shippes
which were on the other side of the point, which was part of
a company ordeined for to keepe and defende the cost,
which were more then foure hundred. Straightwayes the
captaine of the seuen shippes came foorth to knowe what we
were, and what chanced shalbe told you in this chapter
following.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The captaine Omoncon is come to the prouince of Chincheo, but before
he doth come vnto an anker, he dooth passe some trouble with another
captaine of the sea.</i></p></div>


<p>This captaine Omoncon, when he saw that the ships did
make towards him, hee cast about his shippe and passed
alongst by the watch towre, making his way towards the
towne, where he was a natural subiect and nigh at hand,
being but two leagues from the point: which being perceiued
by the generall of that bay which was in a redinesse,
who imagined by his working that it should be some shippe
of euill demeanor and their enimies, without any delation
hee issued forth from behind the point with three ships, that
did row with oares verie swift: and gaue them chase, cutting
them off from their pretence: and when he came nigh vnto
them, hee shot at them to make them to amaine: the which
Omoncon would not doo, for that hee supposed (as afterwards
hee did confesse) that hee should be some man of
little estimation, and not the generall of the coste. But as he
drew nigher vnto him, hee did know him by the flagge he
bare on the sterne in the foist<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> wherein he was himselfe with
his souldiers, and straightwayes caused to amaine<a name="FNanchor_2_12" id="FNanchor_2_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> his sailes,
and tarried for him. The generall did the like, and stayed
behinde, sending a boate for to bring the captaine vnto him,
and to declare what he was and from whence he came.
Omoncon did forthwith imbarke himself into his boate without
any resistance, but rather with feare that hee should be
punished for that hee did flie from him. The generall, when
hee saw him, did straightwayes know him (and in that the
fathers did vnderstand by signes), hee was verie glad of his
comming, and gaue him good entertainment.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_11" id="Footnote_1_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> A small craft: from Fusta&mdash;<i>Span.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_39" id="Page_ii_39">[39]</a></span></p></div>

<p>This generall was a goodly man of person, and was verie
well apparelled, and did sit in a chaire in the sterne of his
ship, the which was all couered to keepe away the sunne:
hee commanded the Captaine Omoncon to sit downe by him
vpon the hatches, without chaire or any other thing, who
did obey him, although first hee did refuse it with great
modestie, as not woorthie to haue that honour, which was
not esteemed a little. After that he was set, he gaue him to
vnderstand in effect of all his voyage and successe, and in
what extremitie he left Limahon, and also howe that hee
carried with him the friers and other Spaniards, which went
to carrie the newes, and to intreate of peace with the vizroy
of Aucheo: vnto whome, and vnto the gouernor of Chincheo,
hee carried presents, sent from the gouernor and generall of
the fielde of the Ilands Philippinas. When the generall had
heard this relation, he commanded the boate to returne and to
bring them before him, that hee might see what manner of
men they were of person and the vse of apparell, and likewise
to satisfie himselfe of other desires that came into his mind by
that which Omoncon had saide of them. The fathers and their
companions did obey the commandement, and did imbarke
themselues in the boate (although it were with some feare),
and came vnto the shippe, whereas the generall receiued
them with great curtesie after his fashion, and shewed them a
good countenance, and tokens that he very much reioyced to
see them and the vse of their apparell they ware. But after
awhile hee commanded that they shoulde bee put vnder
hatches, which was the occasion to augment the feare they
conceiued when they were sent for: and the more when they
saw that they were commanded to be shut vp in a cabin with
the interpreter that they brought with them.</p>


<p>This being done, they were in great care howe they might
vnderstand the generals pretence; and at a close doore that
was before the cabin whereas they were, uppon a sudden
they might see that all those that were in the shippe did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_40" id="Page_ii_40">[40]</a></span>
arme themselues in great haste, and the Captaine Omoncon
amongst them: then they heard bases and harqubus shot,
with a great noise of people, which did verie much alter
them: in such sort that they looked euery moment when
they should come and cut of their heads. Whilst that our people
were in this agonie and great feare, Omoncon considered
of them and of the charge that he had to bring them thither:
therewith he sent one of his seruants to giue them to vnderstand
of all that they had heard and seene, wherewith they
did quiet themselues, and put away al the feare that they
had conceiued with their suddain putting downe in the
cabine, and the shooting off of those peeces. The which the
better to giue you to vnderstand, I will first declare vnto
you the occasion (and then after the rest). Limahon had
not so soone taken his course towards the ilands, but straightwaies
it was knowne in the kingdome of China: and the
vizroy of Ochian, by the order that he had from the roiall
counsell, did command all gouernors of such cities that were
nigh vnto the coast, to dispatch away shipping for to go
follow and seeke him, with aduertisement that hee who did
accomplish this diligence with the first, should be very wel
rewarded and esteemed, for that they feared that if the
<span class="sidenote">They call the Spaniards Castillas.</span>
rouer should ioine with y<sup>e</sup> Castillas (for so they do cal the
Spaniards in that country, of whom they haue had great
notice), might thereby grow some great harme and inconuienence,
which afterwards could not be well remedied:
which was the occasion that they made the more haste, for
that if it were possible to take him, or else to spoile his
shipping before that he should come vnto the said ilands.
In accomplishing of this commandement, the gouernor of
Chincheo did prouide shipping, and did sende the captaine
Omoncon with them: but yet he could not prouide them of
souldiers and other necessaries till certaine daies after that
he was gone foorth: so he went till hee came and met with
the Spaniards, nigh vnto Buliano (as aforesaid).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_41" id="Page_ii_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>About the same time the general of the bay that was there
to defend the cost, did dispatch another ship for to enquire
and know where the rouer was, and to bring relation therof,
that straightwayes they might go and assalt him with all the
whole armie. This ship was the fathers of Sinsay, he that
was friend vnto the Castillas, who came in companie with the
friers from the ilands (as it is said), and he went in the said
ship for pilot; who, although hee went out of the port with
great speede, yet with greater hast hee returned againe without
mastes or yardes, for that they lost them in a great
storme and torment that tooke them in the gulfe, whereas
they thought to haue beene lost.</p>

<p>At the same time that the friers departed from Buliano to
Pagansinan, being requested to come thither by the master
of the field (as aforesaid), there was in the same port a ship
of China, that came vnto the ilands to traficke; and being
well informed of all things, as well in what extremity the
Spaniards had the rouer, as also of y<sup>e</sup> going of Omoncon,
and how that he carried vnto the firme lande the aforesaide
friers and their companions. The said shippe departed
in a morning very secretly, ten dayes before that Omoncon
did make saile, and came to the firme land the saide ten
daies before, and gaue notice thereof vnto the gouernor of
all that they had vnderstood, as wel by relation as by sight;
and how that ther came with Omoncon and the Spaniards,
Sinsay, who was he that in al things touching Limahon was
the dooer, and that whatsoeuer shall happen good in this
relation, they ought to giue the praise and thanks vnto him,
and not vnto Omoncon. This he spake for the good affection
he had vnto Sinsay by way of friendship, for that he
was of the same profession, a merchant.</p>

<p>The gouernour of the bay being verie desirous to haue
the rewarde and thankes of the king, with occasion to say
that the sonne of him whom he sent to follow and seeke
Limahon was the chiefe and principall meanes of that good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_42" id="Page_ii_42">[42]</a></span>
successe. Straight wayes, so soone as hee heard the newes
of the shippe that ariued there tenne dayes before (as aforesaide),
he commaunded sixe shippes to goe foorth of the baye
to the sea, with order and commission to bring the ship to
an anker in the sayd bay, and not to suffer him to go into any
other place: and otherwise they could not, at least wayes,
they would bring with them Sinsay, for that they would
send him post vnto the uiceroy, for to declare vnto him all
that had passed particularly. These sixe ships came verie
nigh vnto that wherein was the generall aforesaid, at such
time as our Spaniardes were with the generall, and they
neuer could perceiue it, for that there were many in the
baye, some going and some comming; but when that hee
had discouered them, then he caused our people to be put
vnder hatches because they should not be seene, and commanded
those that were in the shippe to arme themselues
for their defence if need required.</p>

<p>In the meane time that they made resistance with this
ship, one of the sixe ships did borde that shippe wherein
came Omoncon, pretending to take her, and beleeued to doo
it with great ease. But it happened vnto them cleane contrarie,
for that the souldiers that were within did defende
their ship valiantly. Sinsay, with a very good will, would
haue suffered the ship wherein his father came to haue carried
away the other, if the souldiers of Omoncon would haue
consented therunto. They did not only misse of their purpose,
but also many of them were hurt in the attempting to
enter the ship: the saide ship did fall aborde there whereas
was their captaine Omoncon, who at that instant did call
our Spaniardes in his shippe, out of the generalles shippe
whereas they were; which was doone with such speede, that
it was accomplished before any of the other ships could
come vnto them, although they did procure it. Then did
Omoncon arme himselfe to the warre, for to defend himselfe,
his ship, and all that were therein, or to die there. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_43" id="Page_ii_43">[43]</a></span>
fryers and their companions, when they vnderstoode the
cause of their strife and fighting, partly by suspition in that
they had seene, as by that which Omoncon did sende them
worde, did offer themselues vnto him, promising him to
die with him if neede did so require, and requested him to
appoint them what they should do, and they would accomplish
it with a very good will. At this time all the ships
were about that of Omoncon, who was not idle, but put
foorth his artilerie for their defence, asking powder of the
Spaniardes, for that they had little left: the generall did not
depart from the shippe from the time that the Spaniardes
went vnto him, neither did hee remooue out of his chayre,
although all the rest that were in the ship were armed.</p>

<p>At this time the captayne of the sixe shippes of Chincheo
did put himselfe in a boate and came towardes the shippe of
Omoncon for to haue commoned with him; but he would
not suffer them to come nigh, but shot at them, and caused
them to depart against their willes, and called them all to
naught from the poope of his shippe, with manie reprochfull
woordes, saying that they came to steale the honour that hee
with so great trauayle and perill had gotten. Then the
generall, seeing that hee could not goe through with his
purpose, hee determined to leaue him, and therewith to cast
about with his shippes, and returned into the port of the
baye from whence they came. This brought in his shippe
a sonne of Sinsay, to giue occasion vnto his father for to
come vnto him, and likewise his owne father, whome they
did straightwayes put in prison, and his wife and mother:
which is a thing commonly vsed in that countrie, the children
to pay for their parentes, and to the contrarie, the
parents for the children.</p>

<p>Sinsay, who feared the same, woulde not goe vnto his
owne house till such time as he did carrie commandement
from the uiceroy, for to deliuer out of prison those that were
put there without desert: the which was granted by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_44" id="Page_ii_44">[44]</a></span>
uiceroy, with other fauours and great honour, as shall bee
declared vnto you.</p>

<p>Within a little while after that the captayne of the sixe
shippes departed for Chincheo, Omoncon and his companie
ariued at the port of Tansuso,<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> hard by, vpon Wednesday, in

gallant and fresh towne, of foure thousand householders,
and hath continually a thousand souldiers in garrison; and
compassed about with a great and strong wall; and the
gates fortified with plates of yron; the foundations of all the
houses are of lime and stone, and the walles of lime and
yearth, and some of bricke: their houses within very fairely
wrought, with great courts, their streetes faire and brode, all
paued. Before that Omoncon did come vnto an anker, they
sawe all the souldiers and the people of the towne were
gathered together vpon the rockes that were ioyning vnto

as well in the streetes as in any other place where
they come: all such generally be called Loytias, which is as
much to say in our language (gentlemen): the particular
<span class="sidenote">Ensignes to knowe the iustices.</span>
ensignes which they doo vse, bee broade wastes or girdles,
embossed after diuerse manners; some of golde and siluer,
some of the shell of a Turtuga or turtell, and of a sweete
wood, and other some of iuerie; the higher estates hath
them embrodered with pearles and precious stones, and
their bunnets with two long eares, and their buskins made
of satten and vnshorne ueluet, as we haue declared more at
large in the first three bookes.</p>

<p>Then after, so soone as they were come to an anker in the
port, the iustice did send them a license in writing for to
come foorth of the shippe, as a thing necessarie, for that
without it the waiters or guardes of the water side will not
suffer them to put foote a land. This licence was written
vpon a borde whited, and firmed by the iustice, whose
charge it is to giue the licence. Then when they came a
<span class="sidenote">The first landing of the fryers.</span>
shoore, there were the souldiers that were appointed by the
Insuanto in a readinesse to beare them companie, and did
direct and leade them vnto the kinges houses of the sayde
citie: the like hath euerie citie almost throughout all the
kingdome, and there they did lodge them. These houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_46" id="Page_ii_46">[46]</a></span>
are very great, and very wel wrought and gallant, with faire
courtes belowe, and galleries aboue: they had in them
stanges<a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> or pondes of water, full of fish of sundrie sortes.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_14" id="Footnote_1_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Evidently from Etang, <i>Fr.</i>, a pond.</p></div>

<p>The Insuanto had giuen order vnto the iustice of Tansuso,
wherein he had ordained what hee should giue them to eate,
and all other things that should be done particularly by it
selfe, without lacking of any thing, and appointed the captaine,
that hee with his souldiers should not depart from
them not a iot, but alwayes to beare them company whethersoeuer
they went, and not to depart till he had farther order
from him: in accomplishing whereof they remayned with
them that night in the kings house. The iustice of the citie
when that he had lodged them, went himselfe in person to
the waters side, and caused all their stuffe to be vnladen out
of the ship, and caused it to be carried with great care and
diligence vnto the fryers whereas they were.</p>

<p>The people of the citie did presse very much to see these
strangers, so that with the press, as also with the great heate,
they were marueilously afflicted: which being perceiued by
the iustice, he gaue order that they might bee eased of that
trouble, and caused sergeants to keepe the doore, and their
yeomen to make resistance against the people. Yet, notwithstanding,
though they did not trouble them so much,
they ranged about the house and clymed vpon the walles to
procure to see them, as a rare thing, for that they came from
countries so farre off, and apparelled verie different from
that they do vse or otherwise haue seene. So when that the
night was come, the iustice of the citie did make them a
banket according vnto the fashion of the countrie: and it
was in this manner following.</p>

<p>They were carried into a hall that was verye curiously
wrought, wherein were many torches and waxe candles
<span class="sidenote">The vse of their bankets.</span>
light, and in the middest therof was set for euerie one of
the guests a table by himselfe, as is the vse and fashion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_47" id="Page_ii_47">[47]</a></span>
that countrie (which more at large shalbe declared), euerie
table had his couering of damaske or satten very well made,
the tables were gallantly painted, without any table clothes,
neither do they vse any, for they haue no neede of them, for
that they do eate all their victualles with two little stickes
made of golde and siluer, and of a marueilous odoriferous
woode, and of the length of little forkes as they doo vse in
Italy; with the which they doo feede themselues so clenly,
that although their victuals be neuer so small, yet do they
let nothing fall, neither foule their hands nor faces: they
were set downe at these tables in verie good order and in
gallant chayres, in such sort that although they were euerie
one at his table by himselfe, yet they might see and talke
one with an other; they were serued with diuerse sortes of
cates, and very well dressed both of flesh and fish, as gamons
of bacon, capons, geese, whole hennes, and peeces of beefe,
and at the last many little baskets full of sweete meates
made of sugar and marchpanes, all wrought very curiously.
They gaue them wine of an indifferent colour and taste, made
<span class="sidenote">Wine of a palme tree.</span>
of the palme tree (whereof there is no other vsed in all that
countrie), our Spaniardes did vse it, as that which was made
of grapes. All the time that the supper indured, there was
in the hall great store of musicke of diuers instruments,
whereon they played with great consort, some one time and
some another. The instruments which they commonly do
vse are hoybuckes,<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> cornets, trompets, lutes, such as be vsed
in Spaine, although in the fashion ther is some difference.
There was at this banket (which indured a great while), the
captaine that was ordained for their garde, and the captaine
Omoncon and Sinsay. When supper was done, they were
carried into very faire chambers, wheras were faire beddes,
where they slept and eased themselues.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_15" id="Footnote_1_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Hautboys?</p></div>

<p>The next day following, in the morning, was brought vnto
them their ordinarie victualles, and that in abundance, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_48" id="Page_ii_48">[48]</a></span>
well of flesh as of fish, fruits and wine, to be dressed vnto
their owne content, and according vnto their manner: they
would take nothing for the same, for so they were commanded
by the Insuantes. This was brought vnto them
euerie day so long as they were there, and in the way when
as they went vnto Chincheo. The same day ariued a captaine
of fortie ships in the same port, and as soone as hee
was a shore, hee went straightwayes vnto the pallace for to
see the strangers: who being aduertised of his comming,
came foorth and receiued him at the pallace gate, where as
was vsed betwixt them great courtesie. The captaine came
with great maiestie, with his guarde of souldiers and mase
bearers before him, with great musicke of hoybuckes, trumpets
and drommes, and two whiffelers<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> or typp staues that made
roome, putting the people aside: also there came with him
two executors of iustice, or hangmen, hauing each of them
in their handes a set made of canes, which is an instrument
wherewith they doo whippe and punish offenders, and is so
cruell that who soeuer doth receiue sixtie strokes with the
same, although he be a verie stout man and strong hearted,
yet it will kill him, for that hee is not able to abide it.
They doo beate them vppon the thighes and calues of the
legges, causing the offender or patient to lye downe vppon
his breast or stomacke, and commande their heades and
legges to be holden. The iudges, captaines, and loytias
haue ordinarily these officers before them, for to beate such
as will not goe out of the way when as they doo passe the
streetes, and such as will not alight from their horse, or
come out of their close chayres when they doo meete with
them.</p>

<p>When this captayne came vnto the pallace gate whereas
the father fryers and their companions did receiue him, he
was brought on the shoulders of eight men verie richly
apparelled, and he in a chayre wrought of iuorie and golde,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_49" id="Page_ii_49">[49]</a></span>
who stayed not till they came into the inner chamber,
whereas he did a light from the chayre, and went straight
vnder a cloth of estate, that was there ordinarily for the
same purpose, and a table before him: there hee sate
downe, and straightwaies arose vp, and standing he did receiue
the strange guests, who did curtesie vnto him according
vnto their fashion, which is to ioyne their handes together,
and to stoope with them and their heads downe to the
grounde: he gratified them againe with bowing his heade a
little, and that with great grauitie. Within a little while
after, he spake vnto them with great maiestie, bidding them
welcome into his kingdome, being glad of their comming,
saying that himselfe was come to see and cherish them, for
that they should receiue no discontent, as y<sup>e</sup> proofe shal
shew. These speeches being finished, there was brought
foorth certain peeces of blacke silke of twelue vares<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> long a
peece. And his officers did put on the fryers shoulders each
of them two, which was for either shoulder one, and was
brought about their bodies and girt therewith; and the
like was done in order vnto the Spanish souldiers, and vnto
Omoncon and Sinsay, and to their interpreter. But vnto
Omoncon and Sinsay was giuen vnto either of them a branch
or nosegay made of siluer, which was set vpon their heads,
which is accustomable honor that is done vnto such as haue
done some great enterprise, or such like.</p>

<p>After that this ceremonie was done, they played vpon the
instrumentes afore sayde, which came with the captayne.
In the meane time of their musicke, there was brought
foorth great store of conserues, marchpanes, and thinges
made of sugar, and excellent good wine; and so being on
foot standing, hee caused them to eate, and he himselfe from
the chayre whereas he sate did giue them to drinke euerie
one in order, without rising vp, which is a ceremonie and
token of great fauour and of loue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_50" id="Page_ii_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>This being done, hee arose from the chayre vnder the
cloth of state, and went and sate downe in that which was
brought on mens backes, and with declining of his head a
little he departed out of the hall and out of the house,
and went vnto his owne house, whereas by the counsell of
Omoncon and Sinsay within an houre after they shoulde goe
and visite him, the which they did: hee receiued them
marueilously well and with great courtesie, who maruelled
at his great maiestie and authoritie, for that Omoncon and
Sinsay, when they did talke with him, were vpon their
knees, and so did al the rest: yet that which they did see
afterwardes done vnto the Insuanto and viceroy was much
more.</p>

<p>He gaue them againe in his owne house a gallant banket,
of diuerse sortes of conserues and fruits, and excellent wine
of the palme tree, and did talke and reason with them in
good sort, and was more familiar than at his first visitation,
demanding of them many thinges in particular, and beholding
their apparayle and garmentes, with showe of great content
and reioycing.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniardes depart from Tansuso to visite the governour of Chincheo,

<p>After that the fathers with their companions had remayned
two dayes in the port of Tansuso, whereas they
were marueilously well entertayned and feasted at the commaundement
giuen by the Insuanto, as you haue heard, the
third day they departed in the morning towardes Chincheo,
whether they were commaunded to be carried with great
speede and good intertainement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_51" id="Page_ii_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>At their going foorth of the towne they were accompanied
with a great number of souldiers, both hargubushes and
pikes, and before them a great noyse of trompets, drommes,
and hoybuckes, till such time as they came vnto the riuers
side, whereas was a brygandine prouided and made readie
in all pointes to carrie them vp the riuer: all the streetes
alongest whereas they went, there followed them so much
people that it was innumerable, and all to see them. So
when they were embarked, and which was done with great
speede to auoyd the presse of the people, there came vnto
them the captaine of the fortie ships, of whom wee made
mention in the chapter past, with three brygandines, one
wherein he was himselfe, and was marueilously well trimmed,
and in the other two were souldiers that did beare him
companie. As soone as he came vnto them, hee straight
wayes entred into the brygandine whereas the religious men
were with three Spaniardes, and brought with him great
store of conserues, and made them a gallant banket, the
which did indure so long as he was with them, which was
the space of rowing two long leagues, in which time their
pleasure was such that they thought it but a quarter of a
league. From thence he departed from them and returned,
but left many thinges behinde him for their comfort in their
iourney, and made great offers, with an outwarde showe
that it was a griefe vnto him to depart from out of their
companie.</p>

<p>All alongest the ryuers whereas they went was seated with
villages, verie gallant and fresh, both on the one side and on
the other. Some of them did content our people verie
much, who asked the names howe they were called, and the
captaynes answered them and sayde, that those were villages
that did not deserue the honour of a name; but when you
doo come there whereas the king is, you shall see cities that
it shall be a woorthie thing to knowe their names; the which
townes haue three and foure thousande souldiers, such as in
Europe are esteemed for reasonable cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_52" id="Page_ii_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the two leagues, there whereas the captaine
did leaue the companie of our Spaniardes in the riuer, they
came vnto a great baye, whereas was at an anker a fleete of
more than a hundreth and fifte shippes, men of warre, whose
generall was this captaine whom we haue spoken of, that did
beare the fryers and the rest companie. At such time as the
fleete did discouer them they began to salute them, as well with
great peeces of artillerie as with hargubushes and other kinde
of pastimes, which commonly they do vse at such times: and
that is doone by the commandement of their generall.</p>

<p>At such times as they had made an ende of shooting and
other pastimes, then did he take his leaue of them with
the ceremonie aforesaide, and went out of the brygandine
whereas the fryers were and went into his owne, which
carryed him vnto the admiral, wherein he imbarked himself.
Our Spaniardes, after his departure, did trauaile vp the riuer
more than three leagues, hauing continually, both on the one
side and on the other, verie many and faire townes, and full
of people. In the ende of the three leagues they went a
lande halfe a league from the towne of Tangoa,<a name="FNanchor_1_18" id="FNanchor_1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> whereas
straightwayes all such things as they carried with them were
taken vpon mens backs, and carried it vnto the towne before
them, whereas they were tarrying their comming, for to giue
them great entertaynment. At their going a shore, they
founde prepared for the two religious men little chayres to
carrie them vppon mens backes, and for the souldiers and
the rest of their companions was ordayned horse. The
fathers did refuse to be carried, and would haue gone a foot,
for that the way was but short and pleasant, full of greene
trees; and, againe, for humilitie, refusing to be carried in so
rich chaires, and vppon mens backes of so good a vocation
as they seemed to be. But Omoncon and the other captaine
would not consent thereunto, saying, that it was the order
giuen by the Insuanto, and that they could not by any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_53" id="Page_ii_53">[53]</a></span>
meanes breake, but performe in all points, or else to be
cruelly punished for the same&mdash;I meane such captaines as
had the charge for to garde and beare them companie&mdash;and
that no excuse could serue them; and, againe, that it was
conuenient so to be done, for y<sup>t</sup> from that time the Chinos
should respect them and vnderstande that they were principal
persons, for y<sup>t</sup> they were carried vpon mens backes as they
do their loytias.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_18" id="Footnote_1_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Tong-gan.</p></div>

<p>The fathers obeyed their reasons, and entred into the
chayres, and were carried with eight men a peece, and the
other their companions with foure men a peece, according
vnto the order giuen by the gouernor. Those that carried
the chaires, did it with so good a will, y<sup>t</sup> there was striuing
who should first lay hands to them. This towne of Tangoa
hath three thousand souldiers, and is called in their language
Coan: at the entring in, it hath many gardens and
orchards, and a streete, where through they carried the
Spaniards vnto their lodging, they affirmed it to be halfe
a league long; and all the streete whereas they went it
was full of bordes and stalles, where on was laide all
kinde of merchandise, very curious, and things to be eaten,
as fresh fish and salt fish of diuers sortes, and great abundance
of foule and flesh of al sorts, fruits and greene herbs, in
such quantitie that it was sufficient to serue such a citie as
Siuell is. The presse of people was so much in the streets,
that although there were many typstaues, and souldiers that
did make way wheras they went, yet could they not passe
but with great difficultie. So they were brought vnto the
kings house, which was very great, marueilously wel wrought
with stone and brick, and many halles, parlers, and chambers;
but none aboue, but all belowe. So soone as they
were afoote, there was brought from the captaine or iustice
of the towne, whom they doo call Ticoan, a message, bidding
them welcome, and therewith a present, which was
great store of capons, hens, teales, ducks, geese, flesh of four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_54" id="Page_ii_54">[54]</a></span>
or fiue sorts, fresh fish, wine, and fruits of diuers sorts, and
of so great quantitie that it was sufficient for two hundreth
men. All the which they would haue giuen for a little coole
aire, by reason that it was than very hoat wether; and againe
the great number of people y<sup>t</sup> came thether to see them did
augment it the more.</p>

<p>So in the euening the two Spanish souldiers went forth
into the streets to walk abrode, and left the two fryers
within their lodging, vnto whom afterwardes they did giue
intelligence of all things that they had seene, which did
cause great admiration: the wall of the towne was very
brode, and wrought with lyme and stone, full of loope holes
and watch towers. And as they passed through the streetes
there came foorth of a house a very honest man as it seemed,
who was very well apparelled, and stayed them, for that in
the same house there were certaine dames, principall personages,
that did see them a farre off, and not content therewith,
they did request them with great curtesie for to enter
into the house that they might the better see them: the
which they did straightwaies accomplish, and entring in they
were brought into a court, whereas was set chayres for them
to sit downe, and the ladies were there a little from them
beholding them with great honestie and grauitie. Then a
little after they sent them a banket, with marchpanes and
sweet meates made of sugar, which they did eate without
any curiositie, and dronke after the same. The banket
being done, they made signes and tokens vnto them that
they receiued great content with their sight, and that they
might depart when y<sup>t</sup> their pleasure was; the which they
did after y<sup>t</sup> that they had made great curtesies, with thank e
for their friendship receiued of both parts.</p>

<p>So after they had taken their leaue they went to see a
house of pleasure y<sup>t</sup> was hard by y<sup>e</sup> town wall, wrought
vpon the water, with verie faire galleries and open lodges
for to banket in, made of masons worke, and therein many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_55" id="Page_ii_55">[55]</a></span>
tables finely painted, and round about it sesterns of water
wherein was store of fish, and ioyning vnto them tables of
very faire alabaster, all of one stone, and the least of them
was of eight spannes long: and rounde about them were
brookes of running water, that gaue a pleasant sounde in the
meane time they were banketting, and nigh thereunto many
gardynes full of all sortes of flowers. And a little from that
place they sawe a bridge all of masons worke, and the stones
verie well wrought and of a mightie biggnesse; they measured
some of them that were twentie and two and twentie
foote long and fiue foote brode, and seemed vnto them that
it was a thing impossible to be layde there by mans handes.
Of this bignesse, yea and bigger, they did see layde vppon
manie other bridges, in the discourse of their voyage going
to Chincheo and Aucheo. In this towne they tarried and
rested themselues all that night, marueiling verie much at
that which they had seen. The next day in the morning,
when they were vp and readie, they found in the house all
thinges in a readinesse and in verie good order for their departure,
as well their little chayres<a name="FNanchor_1_19" id="FNanchor_1_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and horse, as for men to
carrie their stuffe and apparell, which did not a little make
them to marueile, how that euerie one of them with a waster<a name="FNanchor_2_20" id="FNanchor_2_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
vpon their shoulders, did diuide their burden in two partes,
sixe roues before and sixe roues behinde, and did trauaile
with the same with so great ease and swiftnes that the horse
could not indure with them. They went vnto the Ticoan
his house, he who sent them the present ouer night, to giue
him thankes for his courtesie, and to take their leaue of him.
They found him with great maiestie, but yet gaue them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_56" id="Page_ii_56">[56]</a></span>
great and good entertainment, and craued pardon at their
hands, if that he did not giue them the entertainement and
courtesie as they deserued. He did likewise put vpon each
of them two peeces of silke, in the same order as the gouernour
of Tansuso did. So when they had surrendred vnto
him thankes, they tooke their leaue and departed from
Chincheo, whereas was the Insuanto or gouernor, by whose
order was showed vnto them all the courtesie as you haue
hearde.</p>

<p>From this towne of Tangoa vnto Chincheo, is thirteene
leagues, and so plaine way that it giueth great content to
trauaile it. In all the waye, they could not see one spanne
of ground but was tilled and occupied. The like they doo
saye is of all the grounde that is in the whole kingdome: it
is full of people, and the townes one so neere to another,
that almost you can not iudge them to be maine townes, but
one; for that there was but a quarter of a league distant one
towne from another, and it was tolde vnto them, that in all
the prouinces of the kingdome, it is populared in the same
order. All their ground they till is watered, which is the
occasion of the fruitefulnesse thereof, so that they doo gather
fruite all the yeare long, and our Spaniardes did see in all
places whereas they came, that they were gathering of rice,
some newe sprung up, some with eares, and some rype.
They doo plough and till their ground with kine, bufalos,

yet be their hornes but of a spanne long, and turning backwards

<p>All the hie waies are couered with the shadowe of verie
faire orchardes, which do garnish it verie much, and they
are planted in verie good order; and amongest them there
are shoppes, whereas is solde all manner of fruites, to the
comfort of all such as doo trauaile by the way, which is an
infinite number, some on foote, some on horsebacke, and
others in little chayres. Their waters by the hie waies are
verie good and light, although the wether, at that time, was
verie hoat, especially at noone time; yet was the water of
their welles and fountaynes verie coole. The same day,
when they had trauayled halfe way, they saw a farre off
comming marching towardes them in verye good order, a
squadron of souldiers, which, at the first, caused them to
maruaile, and to be a fraide, till such time as they drewe
nigher; it was tolde vnto them, that it was the Captayne of
the Garde vnto the Insuanto, or Gouernour of Chincheo,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_58" id="Page_ii_58">[58]</a></span>
who came by his order to receive them, with foure hundred
souldiers, verie well armed with pickes and hargubushes, and
well apparelled. So soone as the captaine came vnto them,
he was mounted on a bay horse, but of small stature, as they,
for the most part, bee in all that prouince, hee alighted, and
came vnto the fathers and his companions (who likewise did
alight from their little chayres), and did salute the one the
other with great courtesie. And the captayne tolde them,
how that the gouernour did sende him with those souldiers
for to receive him, and to beare him companie, and howe
that hee was in the citie tarrying their comming, with great
desire to see them; and commaunded that, with all speede
possible, they should shorten the way.</p>

<p>The captaine came verie well apparelled, with a chayne of
golde about his necke; a man of a good audacitie and vnderstanding.
Harde vnto his stirryp hee had a page that went
<span class="sidenote">A thing to keepe away the sunne.</span>
with him, and carried a great tira sol, made of silke, that did
shadowe him all over. The bunnett that this captaine did
weare, was like vnto them that before they had seene others
weare; hee had before him great musicke of trompets and
hoybuckes, whereon they played in great concorde. This
captaine, with his foure hundreth souldiers, did continually
garde them, till they came vnto the citie of Chincheo, and
never departed from them a iot; the which was done more
for pompe, and to showe their maiestie, then of necessitie;
for that although the people are infinite and without number,
yet do they weare no weapons, for that they are commanded
<span class="sidenote">The people of the countrie weare no
weapons, but the souldiers.</span>
by the lawe of the countrie to the contrarie, vpon paine of
death, of what state or degree soever he be; but onely the
souldiers, such as are in euery towne for the garde thereof,
and the garrisons that the king hath continually readie to
come foorth, when that any occasion shall serue.</p>

<p>In this hie way continually, there went and came manye
packe horses, laden with marchandice and other thinges;
but the most parts of them were mules. The hie wayes are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_59" id="Page_ii_59">[59]</a></span>
verie brode, that twentie men may ride together on a ranke,
and one not hinder an other, and are all paued with great
stones, and they say that the wayes throughout all the other
prouinces be in the same order, and was done by a king of
that countrie, who spent vpon the same a great part of his
treasure. And it seemeth to be true, for that our Spaniards
trauelling in that countrie, ouer high and mightie mountaines,
yet did they finde the waies plaine, in such sort as hath been
told you.</p>

<p>Vpon a Saterday, being the eleuenth of July, came our
Spaniards vnto the citie of Chincheo, four houres before it
was night. This citie is of the common sorte in that kingdome,
<span class="sidenote">Chincheo hath seuentie thousand housholds.</span>
and may haue seuentie thousande householdes. It is
of great traficke, and well prouided of all things, for that the
sea is but two leagues from it: it hath a mightie riuer running
alongest by it, downe into the sea, by which is brought
by water and carried downe all kinde of marchandice.
There is a bridge ouer the sayde riuer, which is supposed to
bee the fayrest that is in all the worlde; it hath a drawe
bridge to serue in time of warres, or for any other necessitie:
the bridge is eight hundreth paces long, and all wrought
with stones of two and twentie foote long, and five foote
broade, a thing greatly to bee marueiled at. At the entrie
thereof, there were manie armed souldiers readie to fight,
who, when they came within hargubush-shoote, did salute
them in verie good order. There was nigh vnto the sayde
bridge, in the riuer, riding at an anker, more than a thousande
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_60" id="Page_ii_60">[60]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">A thousand ships in one riuer.</span>
shippes of all sortes, and so great a number of boates
and barkes, that all the riuer was couered, and euerie one
full of people, that had entred into them for to see the Castillas,
for so they did call the Spaniardes in that countrie, for
the streetes in the suburbes nor in the citie could not hold
them, the number was so great; yet their streets are as broade
as our ordinarie streetes in anye citie in all Spaine.</p>

<p>This citie is compassed with a strong wall, made of stone,
and is seuen fadam hie, and foure fadam broade, and vpon
the gates many towers, wherein is placed their artilerie,
<span class="sidenote">They haue no vse of castles.</span>
which is all their strength, for that they doo not vse in their
kingdome strong castels as they doo in Europe. The houses
of the citie are all built after one sorte and fashion, but faire,
<span class="sidenote">Earthquake in this countrey.</span>
and not verie hie, by reason of the earth quakes, which are
ordinarily in that countrie.</p>

<p>All the streetes (but especially that wherein they passed
at their comming thether), have, on the one side and on the
other, sheddes, vnder the which are shoppes, full of riche
<span class="sidenote">Rich marchandice.</span>
marchandice, and of great value, and verie curious. They
have, in equal distance the one from the other, many triumphant
<span class="sidenote">Triumphant arches.</span>
arches, which doo set out the streetes verie much, and
is vsed in euerie principall streete thoroughout all the kingdome,
in the which they have excellent market-places,
whereas is to bee bought all things that you will desire to be
eaten, as well of fish as of fleshe, fruites, herbes, comfits,
conserues, and all thinges so good cheape, that it is almost
bought for nothing.</p>

<p>Their victualles are verie good, and of great substance; their
hogges flesh, whereon they doo feede much, is so holsome and
good as the mutton in Spaine. The fruites that wee did see,
some were like vnto them we haue in Spaine and others neuer
the like seene by vs afore, but of an excellent taste and
sauour. But in especiall one kinde of fruite, which is
bigger than a muske million, but of the same fashion, but of
maruellous, excellent, and precious victuall, and pleasant to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_61" id="Page_ii_61">[61]</a></span>
be eaten; a kinde of plummes, that is of a gallant taste, and
neuer hurteth anie bodie, although they eate neuer so manie,
a thing prooued by our Spaniardes manie times. The streete
that they came in at was so full of people, that if a graine of
wheate had beene throwne amongst them, it would scarce
haue fallen to the grounde, and although they were carried
in little chayres, vpon men's backes, and the captaine (of
whom we speake of) before them making way, yet were they
a great while before they could passe the streete, and be
brought vnto a great house, which was a couent, wherein
dwelt religious men of that countrie: thether they were
brought and lodged, beeing verie wearie of the presse of
people, that did trouble them verie much, with desire to take
their ease.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The gouernor of Chincheo doth call the Spaniards before him, and
sheweth vnto them the ceremonies that they must vse to have audience.</i></p></div>


<p>The same day that they came into the cittie (as aforesaide),
was a good while before night, with more desire to take rest,
and ease themselues of their iourney, and of the trauell they
had in the streets, by reason of the great number of people
that came to see them, then to make any visitation that night;
but the Insuanto, or gouernor of the cittie, did send, and
commanded that forthwith they shoulde go vnto his house,
for that hee had great desire to see them, the which they did
more for necessitie of the time, then for any good will.
They went forth from their lodging on foote, whether it was
for that the gouernor's house was neere hande, or else per-adventure
at his commandment, which they could not well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_62" id="Page_ii_62">[62]</a></span>
understande, but did as the captaine that guarded them did
commande. In the midst of the streete, wheras was no lesse
number of people then in the other wherby they entred into
the citie, they met with a loytia that came to entertain them
with great maiestie, and had carried before him manie banners,
mase bearers, and tipstaves, and others which carried
settes or whips, which they did traile after them, made fast
vnto long stickes, which were the executioners, the which
doo go alwayes making of way, parting the people before
the loytias, as you haue hearde. The maiestie and company
wherewith he came was so great, that they verely did beleeue
him to be the Insuanto: but being certified, they
vnderstoode that it was one of his counsailers that came from
the gouernor's home to his own house, which was in the
same street whereas hee met with them. This counsailor was
carried in a chaire of ivory, garnished with gold and with
curtines of cloth of gold, and on them the king's arms,
which are certaine serpents knotted togither (as hath beane
tolde you). But when he came right against the Spaniards,
without any staying, he made a signe with his head, and
commanded that they should returne backe againe vnto his
house, which was hard by; the captains did straightways
obey his commandment, and returned with them. The counsailor
entred into his house, which was verie faire; he had in
it a faire court, and therein a gallant fountaine and a garden.
After him entred the Spaniards all alone, the rest remained
without in the street at the loytia's commandment. He entertained
them with verie good words of semblance, and said in
conclusion that they were welcome into that kingdome, with
many other wordes of curtesie: vnto the which they answered
with the same curtesie, with signes and by their
interpreter that they carried with them. This loytia commaunded
a banquet to bee brought foorth, and wine to
drinke. He began first both to eate and drinke. Then
hee commanded to call in the captaine, vnto whome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_63" id="Page_ii_63">[63]</a></span>
was giuen the charge to beare them companie, and
did chide with him verie sharpely and seuerely, because
he did carrie them on foote (they coulde not vnderstande
whether it were doone for a policie or of a trueth, although
the effectes wherewith hee did chide seemed of a trueth); hee
straightwayes commanded two rich chayres to bee brought
foorth for to carrie the fathers, and to giue vnto their companions
horses; the which being done he willed them to go
and visite the gouernor, who did tary their comming, and
that another time at more leasure he would see and visite
them.</p>

<p>They followed their way all alongst the streete, which
seemed vnto them to be more fairer then the other wherein
they entered, and of more fairer houses and triumphant
arkes; and also the shoppes that were on the one side and
on the other, to bee better furnished with richer thinges
then the others, in so ample sort, that what therewith, as
also the great number of people which they sawe, they
were so amased, that they were as people from themselues,
thinking it to be a dreame. To conclude, after they had
gone a good while in that streete, delighting their eies with
newe thinges neuer seene of them before, they came into a
great place whereas were many souldiers in good order with
their hargabushes, pickes, and other armour in a redinesse,
apparelled all in a liuerie of silke with their ancients displayed.
At the end of this place was there a very faire and
sumpteous pallace, the gate was wrought of mason's worke
of stone, very great and full of figures or personages, and
aboue it a great window with an iron grate al guilt; they
were carried within the gates, the souldiers and the people,
which were without number, remained without and coulde
not be auoyded but with great difficultie. When they were
within the first court, there came forth a man very well
apparelled and of authoritie, and made signes with his hande
unto them that brought the Spaniards, that they should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_64" id="Page_ii_64">[64]</a></span>
carrie them into a hal that was vpon the right hand, the
which was straightwayes done. The hall was very great
and faire, and at the end ther of there was an altar, whereon
was many idols, and all did differ the one from the other in
their fashion; the altar was rich and very curiously trimmed
with burning lampes; the aultar cloth was of cloth of gold
and the fruntlet of the same.</p>

<p>After a while that they had beene there whereas the idols
were, there came a seruant from the gouernor, and said vnto
them in his behalfe, that they should sende vnto him the
interpreter, for that hee woulde talke with him, and tell him
some things that they ought to obserue if they would haue
any audience of him; they straightwayes commanded him to
go. And the gouernor said vnto him that hee should aduise
the fathers and the rest of his companions, that if they would
talke and treate of such businesse as they came for, that it
must be done with the same ceremonie and respect as the
nobles of that prouince do vse to talke with him, which is
vppon their knees (as afterwards they did see manie times
vsed); if not that they shoulde depart vnto the house whereas
they were lodged, and there to tarrie the order that shoulde
bee sent from the vizroy of Aucheo. The Spaniards, when
they hearde this message, there was amongst them diuers
iudgementes and opinions, striuing amongst themselues a
good while; but yet in conclusion, the religious fathers
whome the gouernour of the ilandes had ordeined and sent
as principalles in this matter, and whose iudgemente they
shoulde followe, saide that they ought to accept the condition,
seeing that by no other meanes they coulde not come
vnto that they pretended, and not to leaue it off for matters
of small importance, for that therein they make no offence
vnto God, and it may bee a meane vnto the conuerting of
that mightie kingdome, whome the divell maketh reckoning
to bee his owne, and not nowe to leaue it off, but rather to
procure all meanes that may be, as they had began to do;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_65" id="Page_ii_65">[65]</a></span>
and seeing that it is no offence vnto God, as aforesaide,
neither sent as ambassadors from the king of Spaine, I doo
not know to the contrarie, but that we may consent vnto the
will of the Insuant, and in especiall being a thing so commonly
vsed in that countrie. This opinion and iudgement
was followed, although the souldiers that were with them
were of a contrarie opinion. So they sent answere vnto the
gouernor with the said interpreter, that they will observe
their accustomed ceremonies and will do all that he will
commande them according vnto the custome of the countrie:
otherwise they could not be permitted to intreat of such
things, wherefore they came thither from farre countries and
with so great travell.</p>

<p>When that the Insuanto understood that the Spaniards
woulde enter with the reuerence accustomed, and in such
order as was declared vnto them, hee straightwaies commanded
that they should come into the hall whereas he was,
which was a thing to be seene, as well for the bignes as for
the riches that was in it, the which I do let passe because I
would not be tedious. The Spaniards were carried foorth
out of that hall whereas they were first, and after that they
had passed the court whereas they came in, they entred into
another hall as bigge as the first, whereas were many souldiers
with their weapons in their hands, in verie good order
and richly apparelled, and next vnto them were many tipstaves
and sergeants, with different ensignes or badges, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_66" id="Page_ii_66">[66]</a></span>
apparelled with long robes of silke, garded and embroidered
with gold, and euery one of them had a helme on his heade,
some of siluer and other some of tynne guilt ouer, which
was a gallant thing to see; all had long haire and dyed
yealow, which hong downe behind their eares vpon their
backes; they were placed in very good order, and made a
lane that the Spaniards might passe thorough: then they
came into a gallerie, which was ioyning vnto a chamber
where the gouernor was, and there they heard such a noise
of instruments of diuerse sorts, which indured a good while,
and was of so great melodie that it seemed vnto them that
they neuer before heard the like, which caused vnto them
<span class="sidenote">Great maiestie.</span>
great admiration to see so great maiestie amongst gentiles.
When the musicke was ended they entered into the hall
aforesaid, and had not gone many steps, when as they met
with the counsailer that met with them in the streete aforesaid,
and with him other two of his companions, all on foote
and bare headed before the gouernor, and their ensignes of
maiestie left off: which is generally vsed in all the kingdome,
the inferior to make anie shewe when that hee is
before his superior. Then they made signes vnto them for
to kneele downe, for that the Insuanto was nigh at hande in
a rich tower, vnder a canopie of great riches, and did represent
so great maiestie as the king himselfe: he did entertaine
them with tokens of great loue and humanitie, and tolde
them by their interpreter that they were verie well welcome,
and that he did greatly reioyce to see them, with many other
words of great favour. This gouernor was a man of goodly
person, well fauored, and of a merrie countenance, more
then any that they had seene in all that countrie. He caused
to be put upon the shoulders of the fathers and of the souldiers
that were with him, euery one of them, two peeces of
silke, which was crossed about them like skarfes, and likewise
to either of them a branch of siluer: the like curtesie
he did vnto the captaine Omoncon and vnto Sinsay, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_67" id="Page_ii_67">[67]</a></span>
commanded to give vnto all their seruants euery one of them
a mantle of cotton painted. This ceremonie is vsed in that
kingdome vnto al captaines and other men that haue done
some valiant exploit (as we haue tolde you before). This
being doone, the fathers did giue vnto him the letters which
they carryed from the gouernor and generall of the fielde,
and a note of the present that was sent him, crauing pardon
for that it was so smal, but time and oportunitie would not
serue as then to sende vnto him a thing of greater price and
valor; certifying him, that if the friendship which they pretended
did go forwards, and come to be established, that
then all things should be amended and amplified. He answered
vnto their profers with words of great fauor, and
made signes vnto them to arise and to go and take their
rests there whereas they were lodged; the which they did,
and founde all thinges in verie good order and well furnished,
as well of beddes as all other necessaries, which was
done by the commandement of the gouernour. Before they
departed out of the pallace, the captaine of the guard did
carrie them vnto his lodging, which was within the court,
and there he made them a banquet with conserues, and
fruits in abundance: the which being doone, hee and other
gentlemen of the pallace did beare them companie vntill
they came to their lodgings, which they greatly desired,
for that they were wery of their iourney, and also with
the trouble of the great presse of people that pressed on them
in the streets and otherwise for to see them: the which
captaine of the guard did appoint a company of souldiers
for to gard them both night and day, the which was done
more for maiesty then for necessitie or securitie of their
persons. They had a steward appointed to prouide them
and all their company of all thinges necessarie, and that in
abundance, and not to take of them any thing, which was
giuen by particular commandement by the gouernour.</p>

<p>The next day following, which was Sunday the twelfth of

Spaniards to visite them, vsing many ceremonies according
to their custome with fauorable words, promising to performe
it in deeds, when and as neede did so require; and
such as could not go themselues did send their seruants,
bidding them welcome and to knowe of their good healthes,

Spaniards did make answere, and gratified them all, as well
those that came in person as the other that sent their seruants;

hauing great admyration to see the good behauiour, nurture,

discreation they had in the demanding of anie thing they
would knowe, as also in their answers made to our requests.
The next day the Insuanto sent a commandement wherein
he willed two fathers to remaine in their lodgings and take
their ease, but the two souldiers, Pedro Sarmiento and
Miguel de Loarcha, should come and speake with him, and
that they should bring with them their interpreter, for that
hee had one there with him who was a Chino, and vnderstood
the language of the Philippinas, but so badly that
they coulde not by his interpretation talke of any matter of
importance. So when they came thither, they were brought
whereas hee was, but with lesse ceremony then on the first
day, but yet they found him with the like maiestie as before.

although hee had beene informed particularly in all thinges
by the captaine Omoncon and Sinsay, yet he was in a ielousie
that they tolde him not the trueth. Hee was nothing
deceiued in that hee suspected, for after that our souldiers
had made a true relation of the comming of the rouer vnto
Manilla, and of all the rest as you have heard in the discourse
thereof in this booke, he found that they differed
very much the one from the other, for that they did attribute
it wholly vnto themselves to get honor and benefite:
but the Insuanto, like a wise man, straightwayes vnderstood
their pretence. But when that he perceiued that Limahon
was neither dead nor prisoner, but only besieged, he offered
vnto them that if they would returne againe vnto Pagansinan
<span class="sidenote">He offered 500 shippes of warre.</span>
vpon him whereas he was, hee would giue vnto them fiue
hundred ships of warre, with people sufficient to serue both
by sea and lande, and more if they would request. They
answered him, that all such cost and labour were but in
vaine, for that the generall of the fielde who hath him in
siege, with the people and ships that he hath, are sufficient
to ende that enterprise, and to send him hither alive or
deade, and that long before that their fleete should come
thither. And besides this, their ilands were poore of victuals,
and could not sustaine so great an armie many dayes.
Being satisfied with these reasons, he gaue place that the
interpreter which they brought should come in where as
they were, for hee remained at the doore without, for that
he would be fully certified to auoid the suspitious doubt he
had before he come in presence, yet he did help them very
much. So when their interpreter was come in, the Spaniards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_70" id="Page_ii_70">[70]</a></span>
seeing good occasion and opportunitie for to declare that
which passed the day before betwixt them and the fathers,
<span class="sidenote">Note the Spaniards insolencie.</span>
touching the speaking vnto him on their knees: and seeing
as it seemed vnto them that he was at that time in a good
mind for to heare them, they did vtter vnto him all the
whole contention; after that they had declared many reasons
of great consideration, to giue them to vnderstand that it
was not conuenient to do it, but especially to religious men,
who were there as principals ouer the rest, vnto whom the
king of Spaine (their lord) himselfe both stand on foote,
when as they do intreat of any matter, although it be but of
small importance; for that they are priests and ministers of
God, whom he doth worship and reuerence.</p>

<p>The Insuanto with a merry countenance did answere
them, that vnto that time he vnderstood no more of them
then in that he was informed by the captaine Omoncon, and
did not acknowledge them to be any other but Castillas;
without knowing wherefore they came, nor from whom, for
lacke of the letters sent from their gouernor and generall of
the fielde the first time that he spake with them; neither
had he any knowledge of the custome of their countrie, yet,
notwithstanding that which hath passed heere, without any
exception of person, if they would take it in good part, in
that which is to come shall be amended: and from that day
forwards, at al times whensoeuer it were their pleasure to
come of themselues, or at such time as they were sent for, for
to talke with him as they doo vse in Castilla or Spaine, vnto
such of their dignitie and vocation, the which he granted
with a very good will; although hee [did] not grant vnto
any that preheminence, no not vnto a vizroy, except he were
an ambassador sent from some king. With this resolution,
and with many other good wordes they tooke their leaue of
him, and went ioyfull and content vnto their lodgings,
wheras they found the friers wearie with entertaining of
such as did visite them, and with great desire to see them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_71" id="Page_ii_71">[71]</a></span>
to knowe wherefore the Insuanto did send for them, with
whome they had beene so long time. But after that they
vnderstoode the effect of the whole, and how that the
gouernor did permit that they should talke with him after
their owne fashion, they were maruellously glad thereof,
and had a very good hope to conclude their pretence,
wherefore they went, and praised God for the good successe
of that which they pretended.</p>

<p>The next day following the gouernor called a gentleman
of his house vnto him, and commanded him to go and visite
the Spaniards, and to informe himselfe of them if that they
lacked any thing, as well in their victuals as in their lodgings,
and to know if they did require any thing particular
to themselues to aduise him therof, and he would furnish

had done vnto the king in the businesse of Limahon. And
also that he should in his name inuite them for the next day
folowing to dine with him in his house. This gentleman
went vnto them and accomplished his message, and the
Spaniards answered, kissing his hande for the great care hee
had of them, saying that they were furnished in all thinges
aboundantly (as in trueth they were), and how they were
maruellously well lodged, cheered, and lacked nothing, and
that the great care hee had of them was agreeable vnto the
hope they had of his good presence and gentlenesse, accepting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_72" id="Page_ii_72">[72]</a></span>
the inuiting for the next day, the which was giuen them,
and accomplished in this forme following.</p>

<p>The next day when they went vnto the pallace, which was
at dinner time, they were caried into a hall that was below
in the second court, whereas were many chaires of velvet
and tables that were painted with their frontals before; they
had no table clothes on them, for that they doo not vse any
in that countrie, as hath beene told you in the first part of
this historie, neither is it needfull for their manner of feeding.
In the first chaires they caused the friers to sit downe,
euery one at a table by himselfe, and each of them other sixe
tables, placed in order, compassing rounde like a circle;
then were the Spanish souldiers set in the same manner,
and each of them had fiue tables, and next vnto them the
captaine of the guard belonging vnto the gouernor, and two
other captaines, and euerie one of them had three tables;
for that it is the custome of that countrie to make a difference
in the qualitie of the guests by the number of the tables.
All these were placed in circle or compasse (as aforesaide)
that they might see one another. In the midest betwixt
them there was a round compasse whereas was represented
a comedie with much pastime, and indured all the dinner
time, and a good while after. There was also great store of
verie good and excellent musicke, accompanied with gallant
voyces, also iesters, with puppets and other thinges of great
pastime, to drive the time away.</p>

<p>On the first table was set, to euery one of the guestes, little
baskets wrought with golde and siluer wyre, full of sweete
meates made of sugar, as marchpanes, castels, pitchers, pots,
dishes, dogges, bulles, elephants, and other things verie
curious, and all guilt: besides this there were many dishes
full of flesh, as capons, hennes, geese, teales, gamons of
bacon, peeces of beef, and other sortes of flesh wherewith
all the tables were replenished, sauing that whereat they did
sit to dine, which was replenished with victuals that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_73" id="Page_ii_73">[73]</a></span>
dressed (for all the other was rawe), and was of so great
aboundance that there was at times more than fiftie dishes,
and they were serued with great curiositie. They had wine
of diuers sorts, and of that which they doo make in that
countrie of the palme tree, but of so great excellencie, that
they founde no lacke of that which was made of grapes.
The dinner endured foure houres, and according vnto the
aboundance and diuersitie they had in victuals, it might
have indured eight houres, for it was in so good order that
it might haue beene giuen vnto any prince in the world.</p>

<p>Their seruants and slaues that they brought with them
at the same time, did dine in another hal nigh vnto the
same, with so great abundance as their masters. When
dinner was done, the gouernor commanded the people to
come vnto him, with whom he did talke and comon with
great friendship and good conuersation, and would not consent
that they shoulde kneele downe, neither to bee bare
headed. So after that hee had made vnto them tokens of
friendshippe, and detained them a while in demaunding of
many thinges, lastly he told them that there was an order
come from the vizroy of Aucheo, that they shuld go thither
with great speede, so that it did require that they shoulde
depart the next day following, for the which they were
veri glad and ioyfull, for that they had great desire the one
to see the other; and againe with him they might treate and
comon touching their comming into that countrie, and for
what intent, and for all other things needful, for that he was
a man fit for their purpose, and one wellbeloved of the king.
So hee tooke his leaue of vs with great friendship and curtesie,
who did surrender the same after our custome, putting
of our cappes, and making reuerence, for the which hee
made shewe that it greatly contented him.</p>

<p>At their going foorth out of the hall they found the captaine
that did dine with them, and with him many other
gentlemen that tarried their comming for to beare them company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_74" id="Page_ii_74">[74]</a></span>
vnto their lodging; going before them many seruants,
that did carie the raw meate that was vpon the other tables
ouer and aboue that which they did eate on, the which was
done for great maiestie, and a ceremony verie much vsed in
that kingdom, so many times as they do make any banquet.</p>

<p>So when they came vnto their lodging they founde that
the Insuanto had sent them a very good present, in the
which was for euery one of them four peeces of silke, and
counting chestes with other thinges, and certaine painted
mantels for the seruants and slaues. So after they had taken
their leaue of the captaines and gentlemen that did beare
them companie home, they beganne with great ioy to put all
thinges in order for their iourney the next day following.</p>

<p>The next day in the morning, before that the Spaniards
were stirring, there was within the house all thinges necessary
for their iourney, as well of little chaires as of horses
and men for to carrie them and their stuffe, the which they
did with so good a will (as aforesaid) that they did fall out
and striue amongst themselues who should be the first that
should receiue their burthen. So all things being in good
order they departed, hauing in their companie the same
captaine and souldiers, that vnto that time had beene their
guard, vntil they came vnto the cittie of Aucheo whereas
the vizroy was. This iourney was vnto them ioyfull, as well
for to entreate of matters touching their comming, and to
be resolued what they shuld do, as also to depart out of
Chincheo whereas they passed much trouble, by reason of
the great number of people that came for to see them, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_75" id="Page_ii_75">[75]</a></span>
neuer would be satisfied, and y<sup>t</sup> was in such extremity that
some dayes at tenne of the clocke in the night the streetes
round about their lodging were full of people, and onely to
see them, which caused great trouble and heate with their
rumor and presse amongst them. This day, by reason they
vnderstood that they should depart, the prease and multitude
of the people was so great, that although they had tip
staues before them to beate the people away and to make
roome, yet was it almost night before they could get out of
the citie, so that they were constrained to remaine in a towne
there hard by all night, where as by the commandement of
the gouernour they were verie well lodged, and their supper
made readie in verie good order, as it was in seauen dayes
together, till such time as they came vnto Aucheo, without
taking for the same, or for anie other thing necessarie for
their sustentation, anie price or value. There went continuallie
before them a post with a prouision from the
gouernour, written in a great borde wherein was declared
who they were and from whence they came, and commanding
that there should bee prouided for them all things necessarie
in abundance, vppon the king's cost, which was the
occasion that so much people came for to see them, that in
the high waies they were many times disturbed; so with
great trouble, the thirde day they came vnto a citie which
was called Megoa,<a name="FNanchor_1_27" id="FNanchor_1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> which was sometimes the head gouernement,
the which was of fortie thousand housholds, but a
great part thereof was dispeopled; the occasion thereof they
told vs (and was), that about thirtie yeares past the Iaponese,
who brought for their guides three Chinos, who doo nowe
dwell in Manilla and are become Christians, and came vpon
that cittie (to reuenge themselues of an iniurie that was
done vnto them), the which they put in execution with so
great secrecie and policie, that they made themselues lords
of the citie without any daunger or hurt vnto themselues;
for that fiftie Iapones, men fit for that purpose, did apparell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_76" id="Page_ii_76">[76]</a></span>
themselues in Chinos apparell without being knowne, and
came vnto a gate of the cittie, whereas the souldiers that
had the charge thereof were voide of all suspition of any
enimies that woulde come, which was the occasion that their
armor and weapon was not all in a redinesse. And within
a little while after that followed two thousand, that did disembarke
themselues in a secreat and vnknowne place, and
came in verie secret order because they would not be discouered,
and did beset that gate of the cittie whereas their
companions were which they sent before; who so soone as
they saw them nigh at hande, drewe out their weapons the
which they caried hid vnder their apparell, and set vpon the
souldiers (that were voide of feare and vnarmed) with so
great furie and force that they being amazed were easilie
slaine, so that they were lords of the gate, whereas they left
verie good guard, and followed their victorie and made
themselues lordes of the cittie without any daunger vnto
their persons, and did possesse the same certaine dayes, and
did sacke the same in spite of them all, with great harme
and losse vnto the inhabitants thereof, vntill such time as
the vizroy of Aucheo did leuie an armie togither of three
score and tenne thousande men, and went vpon them with
courage for to be reuenged on the iniurie receiued with the
death of all the Iapones; but they seeing that they coulde
not defend themselues against so manie, in one night they
left the cittie and went vnto their shippes, whereas they had
left them in verie good order, and carried with them the
spoile of the cittie, leauing it beaten downe and dispopulared
the greater part thereof, in which sort the Spaniards founde
it, and the iniurie receiued so fresh in their minds as though
it had beene doone the day before.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_27" id="Footnote_1_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Hing-hoa.</p></div>

<p>In this citie they were lodged in the king's house, the
which was of verie great and faire buildings; there was
giuen them to dine and suppe in very good order, and with
aboundance. So soon as they came thither, the friers remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_77" id="Page_ii_77">[77]</a></span>
in their lodgings, but Pedro Sarmiento and Miguel
de Loarcha went to visite the gouernor, vsing the Spanish
curtesie with him, and he receiued them with great ioy and
curtesie. After they had taken their leaue and returned
vnto their lodgings, the gouernor sent to visite them El Tyu,
who is the auncientest of his counsaile, who was with them
a good while verie friendly, and offered his seruice in all
thinges that were needfull, and so departed to his house
maruellously well accompanied.</p>

<p>The gouernor sent vnto the two souldiers that went to
visite him, ech of them two peeces of silke.</p>

<p>At their departure from this cittie, trauelling towards
Aucheo, they passed ouer a mightie great ryuer, by a bridge
all made of stone, the goodliest and greateste that euer they
had seene, whose greatness did cause wonderful admiration,
so that they stayed and did measure it from one end to
another, that it might be put amongst the wonders of that
country, which they tooke a note of. They found that it
was one thousand and three hundred foote long, and that
the least stone wherewith it was built was of seuenteene
foote, and many of two and twentie foote long and eight
foote broad, and seemed vnto them a thing impossible to be
brought thither by man's art, for that all round about so
farre as they could see was plaine ground without any
mountaines; by which they iudged them to be brought
from farre. When they were passed that bridge, they trauelled
al the rest of the day till night vpon a causie that was
very broad and plaine, and on both sides many victualling
houses, and the fieldes sowed with rice, wheate, and other
seeds; and so full of people as in the streetes of a good
towne or cittie.</p>

<p>So when they came into the suburbes of the citie of
Aucheo, they founde order and commandement from the
vizroy what should be done, as more at large shalbe declared
vnto you in the chapter following.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The entrie of the Spaniards into the cittie of Aucheo, and how the vizroy
did entertaine and receiue them.</i></p></div>


<p>After they had travelled more then halfe a league in the
suburbs of the cittie of Aucheo, they met with a post that
came from the vizroy, who brought order that they should
remaine in a house that was appointed for them in the said
suburbs, and there to be lodged for that night, for that it was
late and they could not come vnto the house appointed in
the cittie for them, or else peraduenture to giue content
vnto many that had great desire to see those strangers, for
that they must passe thorough the cittie, and better to bee
seene in the day then in the night. So soone as they were
alighted, there came a gentleman to visite them, sent from
the vizroy to bidde them welcome, and to know howe they
did with their iourney, and also to see that they were well
prouided for that night of all things necessarie, and that in
aboundance. After all the which being done, he told them
that the viceroy did verie much reioyce of their comming;
and for that it was late, and the cittie farre off, it was his
pleasure that they shoulde bee lodged that night in the
suburbes vntill the next day, then will he giue order that
they may enter into the cittie with the authoritie conuenient
vnto their persons. After this gentleman came other captaines
to visite them, and brought with them great store of
conserues, wine, and fruit; which is a common custome
amongst them when that they go in the like visitation, and
it is carried by their seruants in little baskets very curiously
wrought, or else in barrels made of earth all guilt. Within
two houres after their comming thither, there came another
messenger from the vizroy, with many men laden with
capons, hens, geese, teales, gamons of bacon, and conserues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_79" id="Page_ii_79">[79]</a></span>
of diuers sorts, and of great abundance, sufficient for one
hundreth men to sup that night and for their dinner the
next day.</p>

<p>The next day in the morning very early, there came much
people vnto their lodging, sent by the vizroy, and brought
with them two rich chaires for to carrie the fathers in, and
the curtines tied up that they might the better be seene, and
for their companions verie good horses, sadled after the
fashion which they doo vse. They forthwith made haste for
to depart, and although they made great speed, yet were
they a good houre and a halfe before they coulde come vnto
the gates of the citie, and seemed vnto them that they had
trauelled two leagues in the suburbes; the which was so
well peopled, so faire houses, and many shoppes full of merchandise,
that if it had not beene told them, they would
not haue beleeued it to be the suburbes but the cittie it
selfe.</p>

<p>Before they came vnto the gates, they passed a mightie
riuer three times, ouer bridges that were great and verie
faire, and the riuer so deepe that great shippes came vp the
same, but their mastes stooping downe to passe vnder the
bridges. This cittie is the richest and the best prouided
that is in all the kingdome; it is the heade cittie of all the
prouince, verie rich and fertill, and manie townes belonging
vnto it, and but eight leagues from the sea, and hath mightie
riuers wherein great shippes come vp to it as aforesaide. At
the enterie of the citie they founde many gentlemen that
were there at the gate tarrying their comming, who after
they had saluted the one the other after their fashions,
without anie staying they trauelled forwards on, thorough a
great and broad street that went directlie vnto the vizroy
his pallace; vpon both sides of the streete, from the gate
forwards, was placed one by another full of souldiers with
their officers and ancient, euerie one with his weapon in his
hands, as pickes, hargabuses, swords and target, all apparelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_80" id="Page_ii_80">[80]</a></span>
in one liverie of silke, and a bunch of fethers vppon
their crestes. They all stoode still and kept their places,
and would not consent that any should crosse the way in the
streete, whereas they went accompanied with the gentlemen.</p>

<p>They had no leasure to tell the souldiers; but they sawe
that from the gate vntil they came vnto the vizroye's pallace
on both sides, which was a good way, to be full of them, and
all richly apparelled and of one colour. The people that
were at the windowes and in the streete, betwixt the houses
and the soldiers, were so great a number that it seemed to
bee doomes day, and that all the people in the worlde were
there ioyned together in that streete.</p>

<p>So when they came vnto the pallace, which was two houres
after day, the gentlemen that were their guides did cause
the Spaniardes to enter into a roome which was hard by, till
such time as the gate was open, for that it is open but once
a day, and so continue no longer time then the audience
endureth, which is done by the uiceroy once euerie day,
and that is but a small time. But first before he doth enter
into audience, there is shot off foure peeces of artilerie, with
a great noyse of trompettes, drommes, and waites; and there
is no day that passeth without audience, as our people did
see by experience so long as they were there, and were likewise
informed of others. The houre being come, and the
ceremony doone as aforesaide, the gates were opened, and
there was in the court many souldiers apparelled in the same
liuerie that those were of in the streete.</p>

<p>From the middest amongst them came forth a gentleman,
who was, as it was told them, the captaine of the garde of
the viceroy, who came with great grauitie and authoritie
towards the place whereas our people were, and after they
had saluted the one the other, he made signes vnto them
that they should go towardes the gates of the pallace. When
they were within the first court, the which was great and
wrought with mightie pillers, there was a great number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_81" id="Page_ii_81">[81]</a></span>
souldiers, and many sergeants that entred into an other
great covrt, and mounted vp a paire of stayres that was on
the one side, whereas all the people were with great silence,
sauing the captaine of the garde, who went with our people
till they came to the gates of the hall whereas was the viceroy,
at which gate he staied with his head discouered, and
made signes vnto ours that they should doo the like, and to
tarrie there till such time as hee had aduised the viceroy of
their comming, and he to command them to enter.</p>

<p>Then straightwayes came foorth of the hall a man apparelled
in a long robe, of good personage, and asked of the
Spaniards if they would speake with the viceroy, and they
answered, yea: then asked he again from whom they came
and by whom they were sent; they answered y<sup>t</sup> they were
sent by the gouernor of Philippinas, who was seruant vnto
the mightiest king in all Christendome. When he had this
answere he returned againe into the hall, and within a little
while after he came forth and bad them come in, but gaue
them to vnderstand that in entring into the hall wheras the
viceroy was y<sup>t</sup> they should kneele downe, and talke with
him in that order till he commanded to the contrarie; if
they would vse this ceremony that then they should come
in, if not that they shold returne back againe. They who
were certified thereof by the gouernor of Chincheo did not
stand therein, but saide y<sup>t</sup> they would observe the order
giuen vnto them. Therewith he went in, who seemed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_82" id="Page_ii_82">[82]</a></span>
the master of ceremonies, making a signe that they should
follow after him and doo that which he willed them to do.</p>

<p>At the entring in at the doore they stayed a little, and
then kneeled downe right oueragainst there whereas the
uiceroye sate in a chaire verie high like vnto a throne, with
a table before him, and was in so darke a place that almost
they coulde not see his face verie well. On the one side of
him there were some like unto heraldes of armes, with
sceptres in their handes, and on the other side two men of
a gallant comlinesse armed with corselets made of skales of
golde downe to the cafe of their legges, with bowes in their
handes of golde, and quiuers at their backes of the same.
Both the one and the other were vpon their knees. There
was vpon the table before him paper and all thinges necessarie
to write, which is an ordinarie vse amongest them
at all times when there is anye publike audience, and on the
one side of the borde a lion made of blacke woode, which
was (as after they vnderstoode) the armes of that prouince.
So straightwayes he made signes unto them to drawe neare,
which they did, and kneeled downe a little from the table
which was whereas the master of ceremonies did will them.
In this sort they beganne to talke with him by their interpreter,
and tolde them the occasion of their comming into
that citie and kingdome, and from whom and vnto whome
they were sent. But hee made signes vnto them that they
should arise, the which they did with a verye good will,
and did perseuer in their intent. But the uiceroye did cut
them off before they coulde make an ende, and asked if they
had brought any letter from their king vnto the king his
lorde, whome they would goe to see and talke with? but
when they answered no, hee straightwayes took his leaue of
them, saying that they were welcome, and that they should
depart vnto their lodginges and to take their ease, for
that afterwardes they should haue occasion to declare their
minds vnto him, and hee would giue them their answere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_83" id="Page_ii_83">[83]</a></span>
for that the king was farre of, and it requireth a long time
to come whereas he is, but he would write vnto him, and
according vnto his commandement he would make them
answere. And therwith he tooke the letter, and the memoriall
of the present, and commanded in his presence to put
about the neckes of the friers, in manner of a scarfe, to
eyther of them sixe peeces of silke, and vnto the souldiers
their companions, and vnto Omoncon and Sinsay, each of
them foure peeces, and to euerye one of their seruantes two
a peece, and to giue vnto the two fryers and the souldiers,
Omoncon and Sinsay, euerie one of them two branches of
siluer, which is a thing vsed in that countrie vnto them that
haue doone some woorthie deede, as hath beene tolde you
before.</p>

<p>So with the silke about their neckes, and with the branches
in their hands, they returned out of the hall and downe the
staires the way they came, and so through the court into the
streetes, from whence they saw them shut the court gate with
so great a noyse as when they did open it. From thence, at
the request of Omoncon and Sinsay, they went vnto the
house of Totoc, who is the captaine generall of all the men
of warre, and vnto the house of Cagnitoc, who is the chiefe
standard bearer: their houses were nigh the one the other,
very faire and great. They found them with as great maiestie
as the viceroy, and in the same order, with a table
before them, and had on ech side of them armed souldiers
kneeling on their knees. Yet did they not vse our men with
the curtesie that the viceroy vsed, to cause them to stand vp,
which was the occasion that straightwayes they made a
showe that they would depart and be gone, complayning of
Omoncon and Sinsay for that they did carrie them thether,
and tolde them with anger that the gouernour of Manilla
did intreate them in a different sort, who was there resident
for the mightiest prince in all the worlde, and they but easie
marchants; neither was their going thether to be equalled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_84" id="Page_ii_84">[84]</a></span>
vnto the benefite that they came thether for. This discontent
the which they receiued, was the occasion that they
would not go to make any more visitations, although the
sayde Omoncon and Sinsay, for their owne interest, would
haue carried them to the houses of other officers and gentlemen
of the court. But they made signes vnto those that
were their guides to direct their way vnto their lodgings,
for that they would goe to eate somewhat and to take their
ease, the which was ordayned in a great house of the kinges,
there whereas ordinarily the iudges doo sit to heare matters
of iustice.</p>

<p>So at their comming thether they founde all their stuffe in
good order, and their dinner marueilous well prouided, and
the whole house hanged and trimmed as though it had beene
for the kings owne person, with many wayting men and
souldiers, those which did gard them both day and night,
and hanging at the doore two tables or bordes (commanded
by the viceroy), wheron was written who they were that were
there lodged, and from whence they came, and wherefore,
and that none whosoeuer should be so hardie as to offer
them any wrong or disturbance, vpon paine to be for the
same offence seuerely punished. In this house they were
more in quiet than in anie other place whereas they had
been, neyther did the people giue them so much trouble, by
reason of the great care which the iudges had in putting
order for the same, by the commandement of the viceroy;
yet was it the greatest towne and most populed of all that
prouince (although in other prouinces there be that be much
<span class="sidenote">A citie of three hundred
thousand housholds.</span>
bigger), and is affirmed that the citie of Taybin or Suntiem
(there whereas the king and his court is resident) hath three
hundreth thousande housholds, and yet there is a bigger
<span class="sidenote">A citie bigger then the other,
and requireth three daies to go from one gate to an other.</span>
citie in the kingdome, called Lanchin, which requireth three
dayes to go from one gate to an other, and is in compasse
more then seuentie leagues, the which is not far distant from
Canton, that which the Portingalles hath great notice of.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_85" id="Page_ii_85">[85]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Seuentie leagues compasse.</span>
But of certaine there is very much spoken of the mightinesse
of this citie, and I my selfe haue heard reported and
affirmed to bee of a trueth, by men of authoritie that haue
beene in the citie of Canton, religious fryers of the order of
Iesus or Iesuites, to whom ought to be giuen credite.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The wall of the citie is
fiue fadam high and foure broad.</span>
This citie of Aucheo hath a verie faire and strong wall
made of stone, which is fiue fadam high and foure fadam
brode, the which was measured many times by our people,
for that they had a gate out of their lodging that did open
to the same. This wall is all couered ouer with tiles to
defende the rayne water fro hurting of it, which could not
to the contrarie but receiue damage, for that there is no lyme
vsed in the whole wall. They haue not one castle in all this
citie, neyther is there any vsed in all that kingdome; for all
their force and strength is in their gates, the which be made
very strong, with a double wall within verie broade, betwixt
the which are continually many souldiers, such as do keepe
watch and ward both day and night.</p>

<p>Upon these gates they haue much ordinance, but verie ill
wrought (I meane such as were seene by our men); yet they
do say that in other places they haue excellent good and
verie curiously wrought. The whole wall is full of bartilmentes,
and thereon written the names of such souldiers as
are bound to repayre thether in the time of necessitie. At
euerie hundreth paces they haue lodginges, the which are
very huge and great: there whereas in the time of necessitie
doo remaine and dwell their captaynes, so long as their
<span class="sidenote">The citie double mooted.</span>
troubles doo indure. All the wall is fortified with two great
mots or ditches, the one within and the other without, the
which they doo fill at all times when they please by sluces,
which they haue from the riuer for the same purpose, and
doo serue of water almost all the houses in the citie, whereas
they haue their stanges for the most part full of fish. This
mightie citie is situated in a great plaine, and compassed
round about with mightie rockes and mountaines, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_86" id="Page_ii_86">[86]</a></span>
the occasion that it is not so healthfull; and the inhabitants
saye, that it is by reason of the mountaines, and many times
it is ouerflowen in the winter by spring tides from the riuer.
And in that yeare that this doth happen, it doth destroy and
ruinate a great part of the city, as it was at that time when
our people did see it, for y<sup>t</sup> in the winter before they were
troubled with these great tides, which did them much harme.</p>

<p>Now to returne to our purpose, you shall vnderstand that
in the kinges house aforesaide, our people remained all the
time that they were in this citie, wheras they were made
much of, and visited by the principall of the same, but in
especiall of the viceroy, who the verie same day did send to
inuite them for the next day following, who made vnto them
a famous banket, as you shall vnderstand in this chapter
following.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAP_I_XXIV" id="CHAP_I_XXIV"></a>CHAP. XXIV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The viceroy doth banket our people in his owne house two daies,
one after the other.</i></p></div>


<p>The next day after that our people came into the citie, the
uiceroy did sende to inuite them to dinner to his owne
house, whereas he made them a great banket in the forme
following. At their comming vnto the pallace there came
foorth a great number of gentlemen, seruantes vnto the
viceroy, to bid them welcome, with great store of musicke
and tokens of mirth. Being entred into the first court, they
brought them into a mightie hall that was marueilously well
trimmed, wherein was a great number of tables, set in such
order as they were in the banket that was made them by the
gouernour of Chincheo (as hath beene tolde you), although
in the number and furniture did far excell the other. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_87" id="Page_ii_87">[87]</a></span>
before they did sit down, there came vnto them two captaines,
principall men, vnto whom the viceroy had committed
the charge of the banket, to doo all things in his name, for
that it is a custome in that kingdome, that noble men must
not be present in their bankets they make. So the charge
was giuen vnto them to make them be mery, and to bid his
guests welcome. When they came vnto them they vsed
great curtesie, and passed away the time in gallant discourses,
till it was time to go to dinner, and that they began
<span class="sidenote">A strange ceremonie.</span>
to bring in their victuals. Then before they did sit downe,
the captaines did take ech of them a cup in his hande, in
maner of a sorlue,<a name="FNanchor_1_28" id="FNanchor_1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> as they do vse, and being full of wine
they went together whereas they might discouer the heauen,
and offered it vnto the sunne and vnto the saints of heauen,
adding thereunto many words of prayers: but principally
they did request that the comming of their newe guestes
might be profitable vnto them all, and that the friendship
which they did pretende to establish, might be for good both
vnto the one and to the other. This their oration and
prayer being done, they did spill out the wine, making a
great courtesie; then were they straightwayes filled againe,
and making reuerence vnto their guestes euerie one by himselfe,
they set the cuppes downe vpon the tables whereas
the fathers should dine, whereas they were set euerie one by
himselfe. This being doone, the first seruice was set vppon
the bordes, and the captaines were set at other tables, which
were not so many in number, nor so well furnished nor
dressed as the other: the dinner was famous and of manie
diuersities of meates, exceeding verie much that which was
made them by the gouernor of Aucheo.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_28" id="Footnote_1_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> We have not met with this word elsewhere, the Spanish word is
<i>salva</i>, occasionally, and probably here, used for <i>salvilla</i>, a saucer.</p></div>

<p>The time which the banket indured (which was verie late)
there was great store of musicke of diuers instrumentes, as
of vials, gitterns, and rebuckes, and with them many iesters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_88" id="Page_ii_88">[88]</a></span>
did make them merry at their dinner. The which being
done, the saide captaines did beare their guests companie
out of the pallace, whereas they did anew inuite them to
dinner for the next day in the same hall: they obeying their
request did come, wheras was made vnto them a banket
more famous than the first.</p>

<p>This day at the banket was present the Totoc, hee whome
they visited the first day, came in his owne house, and
founde with so great maiestie. Likewise there dyned with
them the captaynes that were at the first banket. In this
<span class="sidenote">Comedies vsed amongest them.</span>
seconde banket they had, as the day before, verie much
musicke, and a comedie that indured long, with manie pretie
<span class="sidenote">Tomblers.</span>
and merrie iestes: there was also a tombler, who did his
feates verie artificially, as well in vauting in the ayre as
vppon a staffe that two men did hold on their shoulders.
Before the comedie did beginne, was tolde them by their
interpreter the signification thereof, that the better they
<span class="sidenote">The argument of their comedie.</span>
might content themselues in the conceiuing, whose argument
was, that in times past, there was in that countrie
manie mightie and valiant men. But amongest them all,
there was in particular three brethren that bid exceede all
the rest that euer were in mightinesse and valiantnesse.
The one of them was a whiteman, the other was ruddish or
hie coloured, and the third blacke. The ruddish being
more ingenious, and of better industrie, did procure to make
his white brother king, the which iudgement was agreeable
vnto the rest. Then they altogether did take away the
kingdome from him that did at that time raigne, who was
called Laupicono, an effeminate man and verie vicious.
This they did represent verie gallantly, with garmentes verie
meete for those personages.</p>

<p>The banket and play beeing finished, according as they
did the day before, the captaynes did beare them companie
till they were out of the pallace, and from thence they went
vnto their lodgings, with their ordinarie companie appointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_89" id="Page_ii_89">[89]</a></span>
by the viceroy, which was that captaine that we haue spoken
of, with his souldiers, who neither night nor day dooth not
depart from their garde.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAP_I_XXV" id="CHAP_I_XXV"></a>CHAP. XXV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniards do carie their present vnto the viceroy, who, hauing
receiued it at the hands of Omoncon, doth seale it and sende it vnto
the king: our men bee forbidden to goe foorth of their houses to see
any thing in the citie: and it doth intreat of other particular things.</i></p></div>


<p>The same night our men did common amongst themselues,
to see if it were good presently to giue order to put in vre
the thing they came for: seeing that they might treat therof
with the uiceroy, he being a man that shewed vnto them so
much fauour and good will. So in conclusion they were all
resolued, that straightwayes the next daye in the morning,
shoulde goe vnto him Michaell de Loarcha and Peter Sarmiento,
and carrie vnto him the present which they brought,
and to haue with them to beare them company Omoncon
and Sinsay; and being presented, to request that hee would
appoint a day when they might goe and talke with him
about principall matters.</p>

<p>This accorde they put in execution according vnto their
determination, and the two souldiers went and carried the
present as it was agreed. So they came vnto the pallace,
and hauing tarried till such time as they opened the gates of
the audience (which was with the ceremony spoken of in the
22. chapter), it was tolde vnto the viceroy that the Castillos
were there and had brought a present, who incontinent saide
that as then he could not talke with them; but that the captaine
Omoncon and Sinsay should enter in with the present,
and that they should returne vnto their lodginges, for that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_90" id="Page_ii_90">[90]</a></span>
he had a care to call them when that opportunitie did serue,
to intreat of all things to their pleasure. They did as they
were commaunded, and those who carried the present in, did
afterwarde giue our people to vnderstand all that had passed
with them; saying that in opening the present, there was a
note thereof taken before a notarie, and straightwayes commanded
to bee put in againe, where it was taken out before
the sayde notarie and other witnesses; the which being done
he sealed it vp, and sent it vnto the citie of Taybin vnto the
king and his counsell, and therewith that which the gouernour
of Chincheo did sende him, as shall be tolde you: for
that they haue a rigorous lawe in that kingdome, that dooth
prohibite all such as haue any office of gouernement to receiue
any present, of what qualitie so euer it be, without
lycence of the king or of his counsell, vpon paine to be depriued
of bearing anie office all the dayes of their liues, and
to bee banished and condemned to weare red bonnets (as
wee haue declared the effect thereof).</p>

<p>This is conformable vnto that which the gouernor of
Chincheo did, in the presence of our people, at such time as
they went to take their leaue of him for to goe vnto Aucheo,
which was, that in their presence they commanded to take
foorth all that they brought him in present; and shewing it
vnto them peece by peece, he asked if it were that which
they had brought, and they aunswered that it was the same
(although it was with troubled mindes), beleeuing that it
was to checke them because it was so small in respect of
their mightinesse: he asked them if there lacked any thing?
they answered, No: then straightwayes he commanded to
put it againe where as it was taken out in their presence,
and before a notarie and witnesses: the which being doone,
was mailed and sealed and so sent vnto the viceroy of
Aucheo in their companie, and saide that hee could not
receiue it without the licence aforesaid.</p>

<p>So our souldiers seeing that they could not be suffered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_91" id="Page_ii_91">[91]</a></span>
enter in with the present, they tooke it for a great discourtesie
and disfauour, and therewith departed vnto their lodging,
to giue the fathers to vnderstande thereof, who liked
not well thereof; but yet they concluded amongest themselues
to suffer for a while, and to commit vnto God the
direction thereof, as it best may be for his holy seruice.</p>

<p>The next day following, the viceroy did send to visite
them, and to aske of them a sword, a hargubush, and a
flaske; for that he would cause others to be made by them;
the which they did send, and afterwards vnderstood that
they had counterfeited the same, although not in so perfect
manner.</p>

<p>Then after a time, our people seeing that their beeing in
that citie seemed to be long and like to be longer, they did
procure to driue away the time in the best manner they
could, and went abroad into the citie and did buy eyther of
them that which they thought best. Whereof they found
<span class="sidenote">All things good cheape.</span>
great abundance, and of so small price that they bought it
almost for nothing.</p>

<p>They bought many bookes that did intreat of diuerse
matters, which they brought with them to the ilands (as
appeareth more at large in the chapter for the same).</p>

<p>The next day they went to see the gates of the citie, and
all such curious thinges as were to be seene so farre as
they could learne or vnderstande, which were many. But
amongst them all they sawe a sumptuous temple of their
idolles, in whose chiefe chappell they counted one hundred
<span class="sidenote">111 idols in one chappell.</span>
and eleuen idols, besides a great number more that were in
other particular chappels; all were of carued worke, verie
well proportioned and gilted, but in especiall three of them
that were placed in the middest of all the rest, the one had
three heads proceeding out of one bodie, the one looking on
the other in full face. The second was the forme of a
woman, with a childe in her armes; the third, of a man
apparelled after the forme and fashion that the Christians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_92" id="Page_ii_92">[92]</a></span>
doo paint the Apostles. Of all the rest, some had foure
armes, and some had sixe, and other eight, and other some
marueilous deformed monsters. Before them they had burning
lamps, and many sweete parfumes and smelles, but in
especiall before the three aboue specified.</p>

<p>But when that the viceroy did vnderstande that our people
did go viewing the citie gates and temples (and perceiueth
that they that gaue him the notice did suspect it that it was
to some ill intent), therewith he straightwayes commanded
that they should not goe foorth out of their lodging without
his licence: and likewise commanded the captaine that was
their garde not to consent thereunto as he had done, and
likewise that none should carrie them any thing for to sell,
for he that did it should be punished with whipping. Yet
notwithstanding, they had euerie day verie sufficient necessaries
for their personages, in such ample wise that there
did alwayes remaine, and not lacke.</p>

<p>In this closenesse and keeping in they suffered many
dayes with much sadnesse, and oppressed with melancholick
humors, to see that their purpose wherefore they went
thether seemed to be long, and euerie day was worse and
worse. Yet notwithstanding they did passe it ouer in the best
wise they could, in committing it with heartie zeale vnto God,
for whose honor and glorie they did attempt that voyage, and
prayed vnto him for to mooue their hearts to consent that
the religious fathers might remeine in that countrie for to
learne the language (as they had begun many daies before),
by which meanes their soules might be saued, and clearely
deliuered from the tyrannie of the diuell, who of truth had
them in possession. So after many dayes that they had
remained in that close estate as aforesaide, they determined
for to goe and talke with the viceroy, and to bee fully resolued
either to tarry or returne from whence they came.
They straightwayes did put it in vre, and what ensued
thereof you shall vnderstande in the chapter following.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_93" id="Page_ii_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_I_XXVI" id="CHAP_I_XXVI"></a>CHAP. XXVI.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniardes talke with the viceroy, and not being svffered, they do
write to him a letter, and he doth answere it by word of mouth, with
other particular matters.</i></p></div>


<p>It hath been declared vnto you, that the same day y<sup>t</sup> the
Spaniardes did talke with the viceroy, he asked them if they
had brought any letter for their king, they answered, No:
he told them that he would write vnto the court, and hauing
answere, they should be fully satisfied of their pretence and
demaund.</p>

<p>But they seeing that his answere was long a comming,
and great delaye made therein, and that they had them as
halfe prisoners, they determined to go and speake with the
viceroy to be fully satisfied of his determinate will and pretence,
and to haue some order eyther to goe vnto the court,
or to remaine in that citie, or else to returne vnto the ilands,
and there to tarrie the time till it pleased God to open a gate
in that kingdome, wherein might enter his holy gospell.</p>

<p>With this then pretended purpose, they did perswade
with their captaine to permit them so much libertie as for to
go and speake with the viceroy, who for that hee bare them
loue and good will did consent therevnto. So they went,
but when they came thether they that kept the gates would
not consent y<sup>t</sup> they should enter, which was the occasion
that they returned vnto their lodgings verie sad and sorrowfull,
and almost without any hope to bring their matter to
passe, for the which they went thether; for that it seemed
vnto them, although they did plainely declare vnto them
their pretence, yet did they worke in such order for to cause
them to depart. In this order they remained in the citie
certaine daies, and for to conclude either to stay there or
depart the kingdome they were resolute; and determined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_94" id="Page_ii_94">[94]</a></span>
write a letter vnto the viceroy, and therein to giue him to
vnderstand particularly that their comming thether into
y<sup>e</sup> countrie was to intreat that betwixt them and the Castillos
there should be peace and friendship, and being concluded
that their souldiers should with that newes depart
vnto the islandes from whence they came, to giue the gouernor
to vnderstand therof, and they to remaine in that
countrie preaching y<sup>e</sup> holy gospell. They could finde none
that would write this letter for them, although they would
haue payed them very well for their paines. Till in the
end, by great request and prayings, the captaine Omoncon
did write it for them, and straightwaies departed vnto the
citie of Ampin that was not farre off, making an excuse for
to go and see the visitor of the prouince, whom they doo
call Sadin: he would very faine haue carried with him two
of our people, y<sup>t</sup> he might haue seene them, but none would
go with him. This iourney which Omoncon made, hee did
it to put away the suspition they might conceiue that he did
write the letter, if that peraduenture the viceroy would take
it in ill part.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote">People in great subiection.</span>
Their letter being written, they found great difficulty in
the sending the same, for that there was none that would
carrie it, neyther would they consent that our men should enter
into the pallace to deliuer it. But in conclusion, what with
requestes and giftes, they perswaded their captayne of their
gard to carrie it, who did deliuer the same vnto the viceroye,
in name of the Castillos, saying that hee tooke it of
them to bring it vnto him, for that they did certifie him that
it was a thing that did import verie much. Hauing read
the letter, hee answered that he would giue the king to
vnderstande thereof, as he saide at the first time. And in
that touching the fryers remayning in that countrie to
preach, at that time he could make them no answere, for
that in such matters it was first requisite to haue the good
will of the royall counsell. Yet would hee make answere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_95" id="Page_ii_95">[95]</a></span>
vnto the letter they brought from the gouernour of Manilla,
and that they might depart, and returne againe at such time
as they brought Limahon, prisoner or dead; the which
being done, then shall the friendshippe be concluded which
they doo pretende, and to remaine and preach at their will.
With this answere they remained without all hope to remayne
there, and did incontinent prepare themselues for to
depart from Manilla, and bought manie bookes to carie with
them, wherein was comprehended all the secrets of that
kingdome; by reason whereof they might giue large notice
vnto the royall maiestie of King Phillip. The which being
vnderstoode by the viceroy, who had set spies to watch their
doings, did sende them worde that they should not trouble
themselues in the buying of bookes, for that hee would giue
them freely all such bookes as they would desire to haue:
the which afterwardes he did not accomplish: whether it
was for forgetfulnesse or other occasion, as wee haue more at
large declared vnto you, we know not: yet did the uiceroy
send and demanded to see some of those bookes that the
fryers had bought; who after that he had seene them, did
returne them againe, and requested of them some writing
of their owne handes, who did accomplish his request, and
sent them written in Spanish and in their own language, the
Lords Prayer, the Aue Maria, and the Ten Commandements,
who according vnto the relation of him that did
carrie the same, saide, that after hee had reade it, he made
showes that he receiued great content therewith, and said
that all which was there written was good.</p>

<p>In the time that they stayed in this citie, amongst all
other things that they vnderstoode to driue away the time
was one, it was giuen them to vnderstande that in one of the
prisons, there was a Portingale prisoner, who was taken in a
shippe of the Iapones with others of his nation, who were
all dead in the prison, and none left aliue but he alone.
Our people being verie desirous for to see him, and to learne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_96" id="Page_ii_96">[96]</a></span>
of him some secrets of that countrie, for that he had beene
there a great while, they did procure to talke with him,
asking licence of the supreme iudge and lieutenant vnto the
viceroy, who did not onely refuse to grant it them, but did
make diligent inquirie who they were that did giue them to
vnderstande thereof, for to punish them, which without all
doubt should be executed with sharpe and seuere punishment.
Yet our people would neuer tell them of whom they
had it, although it was demanded of them diuerse times, and
with great intreatie. They had so great desire to know it,
that they did vse all meanes possible as it appeared in the
boldnesse of their demandes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>There came newes vnto Aucheo that there was a rouer vpon the coast of
Chincheo, which did much harme, and had sacked a towne. The
viceroy doth suspect him to be Limahon, and how that our people,
with Omoncon and Sinsay, had not declared vnto him the truth.</i></p></div>


<p>The Spaniards remained in the citie of Aucheo twentie
days, in the order as hath been told you, without any hope
that the religious fathers should remaine in that countrie for to
preach the holy gospell, which was the principall occasion of
their going into that kingdome. Upon a suddaine there
came newes vnto the citie that the rouer Limahon was vpon
the coast of Chincheo, vsing his olde accustomed cruelties,
and how that he had spoiled and robbed a towne vpon the
sea coast. This newes was throughout all the citie, and appeared
to be true, touching the effect of the dead: yet false
touching the person, for that the rouer was called Taocay,
an enimie and contrarie vnto Limahon, but a friend vnto
Vintoquian, of whom we haue spoken of. But thereupon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_97" id="Page_ii_97">[97]</a></span>
the viceroy and all them of the citie were conformable in the
suspition that they had receiued, which was, that our people
<span class="sidenote">Suspition of euill.</span>
were come into that kingdome vpon some euill pretence, and
to see the secrets thereof, to some euil end, which was the
occasion y<sup>t</sup> from that time forwards they shewed them not so
good countenance as they did before.</p>

<p>These newes was not so soone come, but straightwayes
the viceroy did send for Omoncon (who was then returned
from his visiting) and Sinsay, vnto whom he had done courtesie,
and giuen them the title of loytias and captaynes, and
he did reprehende them verie sharpely for that they had
brought ouer people thether, and sayde that they had tolde
him a lye in saying that Limahon was besieged in such sort
that hee coulde not escape, neither had the Castillos burnt
his shippes, and howe that all was but a made matter
amongest themselues, and howe that the captaines which
they brought, and sayde that they had taken from Limahon,
they had robbed from other places, with other wordes
in the same order, and said that the Spaniardes were spyes
that came to discouer the secretes and strength of the
kingdome, and how that they had brought them thether by
force of giftes that they had giuen them.</p>

<p>They answered him with great humilitie in saying that in
all that which they had sayd they did speake the trueth, and
that it should appeare at such time as the newes of the rouer
should be better knowen, the which, if it shall appeare to
be contrary, they were there readie for to suffer whatsoeuer
punishment y<sup>t</sup> shold be giuen them. The viceroy being
somewhat satisfied with this their iustification, bad them to
depart, remitting all things vnto time for the true declaration
thereof. Then Omoncon and Sinsay came straightwayes to
giue y<sup>e</sup> Spaniards to vnderstand of all that had passed with
the viceroy, and what they vnderstoode of him, which caused
in them so great feare, y<sup>t</sup> for the time which it endured
(which was till such time as they vnderstoode the truth as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_98" id="Page_ii_98">[98]</a></span>
aforesaide) they paied very well for their feasts and bankets
the which they had made them. All this happened in the
time that Omoncon and Sinsay were at variance, and spake
many iniurious words the one of y<sup>e</sup> other, discouering their
intents and deuises, whereby it plainely appeared that in al
y<sup>t</sup> which they had tolde vnto the viceroy, they lied, but in
especiall Omoncon. Sinsay did dissemble, for hee sayde and
tolde vnto all people, that by his order and industrie our people
did fire the shippes of Lymahon, and beseiged him, with
other speeches in the like sort; yet twentie dayes before his
comming thether, all was ended and doone, as appeared.
The occasion of their enimitie and falling out, was for that
the viceroy had giuen vnto Omoncon a title and charge of
more honor then vnto Sinsay, hauing made betwixt them
a consort that the reward or dignitie should be equally
deuided betwixt them, and that the one should speake
of the other the best they could, because the viceroy
should do them friendship. This condition and consort (as
appeareth) was euill performed, by Omoncon being addicted
vnto selfe loue, and seemed vnto him that Sinsay did not
deserue so much as he did, for that hee was a base man, and
of the sea, and he of the more nobilitie, and had the office of
a captaine. All this which I haue said, was the occasion
y<sup>t</sup> the truth came to light betwixt them, and to cause the
viceroye to suspect, that as they lyed in this, they might
also fable in the burning of the ships and besieging of
Limahon.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The gouernours of the prouince do assemble together, to intreat of the
Spaniardes business, and are resolved that they should returne vnto
the ilandes. They do see many curious thinges before their departure.</i></p></div>


<p>With this griefe and care remained the Spaniards certaine
daies, kept close in their lodgings, and were not visited so
often as they were when they first came thether, which did
augment verie much their feare, till such time as they
vnderstoode that the viceroy, eyther of his owne good will
or else by some particular order from the king and his
counsell, had called together all the gouernours of that prouince
of Aucheo to intreat of matters touching Limahon, as
also in particular why and wherefore the Spaniardes came
thether, and to resolue themselues wholly in all things requisite
for the same. So when that they were all come
together, which was in a short time, and amongst them the
gouernor of Chincheo, who by an other name was called
Insuanto, they had particular meetings together with the
uiceroye, in the which they were all agreed to haue a generall
meeting, whereunto should bee called the Castillos, and
to demande of them in publike audience the cause of their
comming (although notwithstanding they had giuen to
vnderstand thereof vnto the Insuanto and vizroy), and being
hearde, to giue them their answere according as they had
determined: for the which vppon a day appointed they met
all togither (but not the vizroy) in the house of the Cagontoc,
and commanded to come before them the Castillas, who
did accomplish their request with a great good will, for that
they vnderstoode that they were called to entreat of their
matter, either to tarry or depart. So when they came thither,
they were commanded to enter into a mighty hall,
whereas they were all set in verie rich chaires, with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_100" id="Page_ii_100">[100]</a></span>
grauitie and maiestie. The Insuanto seemed to bee the
chiefest among them, but whether it was for that hee was
the principallest next vnto the vizroy (or as it was tolde
them), for that it was he that sent Omoncon in the chase of
the rouer Limahon, they knew not; but so soone as they
were entred into the hall, they were commanded to drawe
nigh there whereas they were all placed, without bidding
them to sit downe, neither did they vse any particular circumstances
or curtesie.</p>

<p>The Insuanto tooke vpon him the charge, and demanded
of the Spaniards (by meanes of the interpreter) what was the
occasion of their comming into that country, and to declare
their pretence, for that they would giue vnto them the resolute
will of the vizroy, at whose commandment they were
called and there assembled togither. The Spaniards answered
vnto their request, and said that their comming
thither was to treat with them peace and friendship, by the
order of the gouernor of y<sup>e</sup> Philippinas, who had his authority
from the king of Spaine, with a particular charge euer
since the said islands were discouered, who in all thinges that
possible hath beene, haue shewed themselues, not onely in
words but in deedes, as vnto this day the gouernor dooth
accomplish the same, in ransoming all such Chinos as they
can finde, or come vnto their powers, and send them home
free into their countrie with giftes, and not in this only, but
in other matters, which is not vnknowne vnto them: and
more, that which lastly had happened in the destruction of
the fleete, and the besieging of the rouer Limahon, with
which newes they came thither to intreate and conclude
betweene them and the Castillas a perpetuall friendship:
this was the principall occasion of their comming, the which
if they coulde bring it to passe (as a thing that did accomplish
both the one and the other), they would with y<sup>e</sup> same
newes send word with the souldiers (who came with them
for the same effect) vnto the gouernor of Manilla, who sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_101" id="Page_ii_101">[101]</a></span>
vs thither for that he might send the good successe thereof
to the king of Spaine, and there to remaine in such place as
they woulde appoint them to studie the learning of the language,
and to preach and declare to them y<sup>e</sup> holy gospell,
which was the right way vnto the salvation of their soule.
Unto all the which they gaue attentiue eare, although with
little desire to see the experience, as appeared; for that the
chiefest matter in effect they did let passe, and asked of
them in what order they left the rouer Limahon, and whether
hee might escape or not, and other questions touching
the same matter, which endured a good while without
touching of anie other matter in effect. The Spaniards
answered as they thought, and supposed that at that time it
could not be, but that he was either taken prisoner or slaine.</p>

<p>Then did the Insuanto conclude his speech in saying vnto
them, that they should returne vnto their owne country to
the ilands; and at such time as they did bring Limahon,
they woulde conclude all things touching the friendship
they requested, as also for the preaching of the gospell.</p>

<p>So with this last resolution they tooke their leaue and
went vnto their lodging, with pretence not to speake more
of that matter, for that they sawe it booted out: after they
had giuen their censure: and againe, as they vnderstood it
was by speciall order from the king and his counsaile; and
therewith they beganne to put all thinges in good for their
departure, the which they greatly desired, for that they saw
little fruite to proceede of their great labour and trauell, as
also to see themselues cleare of that manner of prison in the
which they were, not to go forth of their lodgings without
express licence.</p>

<p>So from that day forwards they did procure with all haste
for to depart, and gaue the vizroy to vnderstande thereof;
who answered them and saide, that they should comfort
themselues and receiue ioy and pleasure, and that he would
dispatch them so soone as the visitor of that prouince was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_102" id="Page_ii_102">[102]</a></span>
come to Aucheo, which would be within tenne dayes, for
that hee had written vnto him that he should not dispatch
them vntil his comming, for that he would see them.</p>

<p>From that day forwards hee commaunded that sometimes
they should let them go forth abrode to recreate themselues,
and that they should shew vnto them some particular pleasure
or friendship. So one of them was carried to see the
mustering of their men of warre, which they haue in a common
custome throughout all the kingdome to doo at the
first day of the newe moone, and is sure a thing to be seene:
and they doo it in the field which is ioyning vnto the wals
of the citie, in this manner following.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The vse of their mustering.</span>
There were ioyned togither litle more or less then 20
thousand souldiers, pickemen and hargabus shot, who were
so expert, that at the sounde of the drum or trumpet, they
straightwayes put themselues in battle aray, and at another
sound in a squadron, and at another the shot doo deuide
themselues from the rest, and discharge their peeces with
very gallant and good order, and with a trice put themselues
againe into their places or standings: this being doone, the
picke men came foorth and gaue the assalt altogether with
so good order and consort, that it seemed vnto the Spaniards
that they did excel al the warlike orders vsed in all the
world: and if it were so that their stomacks and hardinesse
were equall vnto their dexteritie and number of people, it
were an easie thing for them to conquer the dominion of all
the world. If it so chance that any souldier should lacke
<span class="sidenote">Souldiers are punished.</span>
in his office, and not repaire to his place appointed, he is
straightwayes punished very cruelly, which is the occasion
that euerie one of them hath a care vnto his charge.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Their mustering is one throughout
the whole kingdome.</span>
This their muster endured foure houres, and it was certified
vnto the Spaniards that the same day and houre it is
done in all cities and townes throughout all the whole kingdome,
although they are without suspection of enimies.</p>

<p>Fiue and twentie dayes after that the Insuanto had giuen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_103" id="Page_ii_103">[103]</a></span>
the resolute answere vnto the Spaniards, came the visitor
thither: and the whole citie went forth to receiue him, who
entred in with so great maiestie, that if they had not knowne
who hee was, they could not haue beene perswaded but that
he had beene the king.</p>

<p>So the next day following the Spaniards went to visite
him, for dueties sake, as also for that he had a desire to see
them. They found him in his lodging, where he began to
make visitation of the cittie.</p>

<p>In their courtes were an infinite number of people, which
came thither with petitions and complaintes, but in the
halles within, there was none but his seruants and sergeants.
When that any came for to present his petition, the porter
that was at the entrie made a great noise, in manner of an
o. est.,<a name="FNanchor_1_29" id="FNanchor_1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> for that it was a good way from the place whereas
the visitor did sit; then commeth forth straight wayes one
of his pages, and taketh the petition and carrieth it vnto him.
At this time it was told him how that the Castillas were
there: hee commaunded that they should enter, and talked
with them a few words, but with great curtesie, and all was
touching the imprisonment of Limahon, without making any
mention of their departure or tarrying. So after a while
that he had beholded them and their apparel, hee tooke his
leaue of them, saying, that by reason of the great businesse
he had in that visitation, he could not shewe them any curtesie,
neither to vnderstande of them what their request and
desire was; but gaue them great thankes for their curtesie
shewed, in that they woulde come to visite him. Hee was
set in the same visitation after the same manner and order as
they founde the gouernor of Chincheo, and the vizroy, with
a table before him, with paper, ynke, and other thinges
readie to write, the which, according as it was giuen them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_104" id="Page_ii_104">[104]</a></span>
to vnderstand, is a common vse in all y<sup>e</sup> kingdome, vsed
with all iudges, whether it be for sentence of death, or
other matters of iustice, as hath beene told you many times
before.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_29" id="Footnote_1_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> These words, "in manner of an o. est," are supplied by the translator,
and would seem to be intended for the crier's exclamation of "Oyez."</p></div>

<p>Three dayes after the visitor was come thither, the Insuanto
departed for his owne house, with order that with all
speede possible he should ordaine shippes wherin the Castillas
should returne vnto the Philippinas.</p>

<p>Likewise the same day, all those that were there assembled
by the order of the vizroy departed vnto their owne
houses. And the Spaniards were commanded for to stay
vntill the full of the moone, which should bee the twentieth
of August, and that day they shoulde take their leaue of
them: for on that day amongst them it is holden for good to
beginne any thing whatsoeuer. Wherein they do vse great
<span class="sidenote">Superstition.</span>
superstition, and doo make many banquets, as vppon new
yeares day, as hath beene tolde diffusedly.</p>

<p>The day before y<sup>e</sup> departure of y<sup>e</sup> Spaniards, there came
some in behalfe of the vizroy to inuite them, and made them
banquet in the order and fashion as at first: although this
(for that it was at their departure) was more sumptuous,
wherein was represented a comedie which was very excellent
and good, whose argument was first declared vnto them
as followeth.</p>

<p>There was a young man newly married, and there chanced
difference betwixt him and his wife; hee determined to go
vnto certaine warres, the which was ordained in a countrie
not farre from that whereas he dwelled: whose acts and
deeds was therein so valorous, that the king did shewe him
great fauour, and being fully certified of his worthinesse, he
sent him for chief captaine of the most importunate enterprises
that might bee offered, who did accomplish his charge
with conclusion thereof with great content and satisfaction
to the king and his counsailers: for the which he made him
his captaine generall, and in his absence did commit vnto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_105" id="Page_ii_105">[105]</a></span>
his charge his whole campe, with the same authoritie that
he had himselfe.</p>

<p>The warres being doone, and hee hauing a desire to
returne vnto his owne countrie and house, there was giuen
vnto him three cart loads of golde, and many iewels of an
inestimable price, with the which hee entered into his owne
countrie with great honour and riches, wheras they receiued
him with great honour.</p>

<p>All the which they did represent so naturally, and with
so good apparell and personages, that it seemed a thing to
passe in act. There was not in this banket the vizroy, but
those captaines which were there the first time: and another
captaine, vnto whome was giuen the charge to bring the
Spaniards vnto Manilla, who was called Chantalay, a principall
captaine of that prouince.</p>

<p>So when the banquet was ended, they were carried with
great company from the hall whereas the banquet was made,
vnto the house of the Cogontoc, who was the kings tresuror
and dwelt there hard by, of whom they were maruellously
wel receiued, with louing words and great curtesie: in
saying that he hoped very shortly to see them againe, at
such time as they shall returne with Limahon, and that as
then their friendship should be fully concluded, and would
intreat with them in particular of other matters. This being
doone, he gaue vnto them a present for to carrie vnto the
gouernor of Manilla, in recompence of that which was sent
vnto the vizroy: the present was fortie peeces of silke and
twentie peeces of burato,<a name="FNanchor_1_30" id="FNanchor_1_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> a litter chaire and guilt, and two
quitasoles of silke,<a name="FNanchor_2_31" id="FNanchor_2_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and a horse. Likewise he sent the like
present vnto the generall of the fielde, and to either of them
a letter in particular: these things were put in chestes,
which were very faire and guilt. Besides this, hee gaue
other fortie peeces of silke of all colours, for to bee parted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_106" id="Page_ii_106">[106]</a></span>
amongest the captaines and other officers that were at the
siege of Limahon, with three hundred blacke mantles, and
as many quitasoles, to be parted amongst the souldiers.
Besides all these, hee gaue vnto the friers ech of them eight
peeces of silke, and vnto the souldiers their companions
<span class="sidenote">To keepe away the sun.</span>
foure peeces of ech of them, and to euery one his horse and
a quitasol of silke; their horse were verie good to trauell by
the way. This being done the Cogontoc tooke his leaue of
them, and willed them to go and take leaue and licence of
the vizroy and the visitor, that they might depart, for that
all thinges were in a redinesse for their voyage: the which
commandement they did straightwayes accomplish, being
very well content and satisfied of the great fauours and curtesies
the which they receiued, both of the one and the
other: likewise of the Totoc, who is captaine generall, whome
they also did visite and tooke their leaue. These visitations
and leaue taking being doone, they returned vnto their
lodging with great desire for to take their ease, whereas
they remained til the next day following, wherin they departed
vnto the port of Tansuso, after they had remained in
Aucheo seuen and forty daies.</p>

<p>The Spaniards departed from the citie of Aucheo vpon a
Tewsday, being the 23 of August, in the sight of all the
people of the citie, who came foorth to see them with so
great presse and thronge, as they did when they first came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_107" id="Page_ii_107">[107]</a></span>
thither into the countrie: they were al carried in litter
chayres, yea their verie slaues, for that it was so commaunded
by the vizroy; the friers were carried by eight
men a peece, and the souldiers by foure men a peece, and
all their seruants and slaues were caried by two men a
peece. Looke so many men as was to carrie them, there
went so many more to help them when they waxed weary,
besides foure and twentie that carried their stuffe. There
went alwayes before them a harbinger for to prouide their
lodgings, and with him went a paimaster, whose charge was
to ordain and prouide men for to cary their litter chaires,
and to giue them for their trauell that which is accustomed,
and to pay all costs and charges spent by the Spaniard.
After that they departed from Aucheo they made of two
daies iourney one, which was the occasion that they came to
Chincheo in foure daies. At their entring into the citie
they found a seruant of the Insuanto, with order and commandement
that they shuld proceed forwards on their
iourney, and not to stay in the citie, but to go vnto the port
of Tansuso, whither he wil come the next day following.
They obayed his commandement, and made so much haste
that in two dayes they came vnto the village of Tangoa,
wheras they had bin before, and particular mention made
thereof. In the same village they were lodged, wel entertained,
and had great good cheere: from thence they went
in one day to Tansuso, which was the first port wheras they
did disembarke themselues, when as they came from the
ilands vnto that firme land: the iustice of the town did
lodge them in the same house whereas they were first
lodged, and did prouide for them of all things necessary and
needfull, and that in aboundance, til the comming of the
Insuanto, which was within foure dayes after; for that he
could not come any sooner (although his desire was) for that
it was very foule weather.</p>

<p>The next day after his comming thither, which was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_108" id="Page_ii_108">[108]</a></span>
thirde of September, he sent and commanded the Spaniards
that they should embarke themselues, for that it was that
day the coniunction of the moone (although at that time the
ships were not fully in a redines). They obayed his commandement,
and the Insuanto himself went to the water
side, in whose presence came thither certain religious men
of their maner, and after their fashion they made sacrifice
with certain orations and praiers, in the which they craued
of the heauens to giue good and faire weather, and a sure
voyage and fauorable seas vnto al those that saile in those
shippes.</p>

<p>This ceremony being done (which is a thing very much
vsed in that countrie) the Spaniards went vnto the Insuanto,
who was there with great company and maiestie: hee entertained
them very friendly and with cheerful wordes, making
an outward shew that hee bare them great loue, and that
their departure was vnto him a great griefe. Then hee
requested them to giue him a remembrance of such thinges
as was necessarie and needful for their prouision for the sea,
for that hee woulde giue order for the prouiding of the
same; the which he did, and was with so great aboundance,
that they had for the voyage and remained a great deale to
spare. Hee then commaunded to bee brought thither cates
to eat, and drink, and gaue it them with his owne hands, as
well the one as the other; hee himselfe did eate and drinke
with them, which is the greatest fauour that can be shewed
amongst them.</p>

<p>The banquet being ended, he commaunded them in his
presence to go abord their shippes, because that was a luckie
day, and also to accomplish that which the vizroy had commaunded,
which was that they should not depart from thence
vntil they had first seene them imbarked. The Spaniards
obeyed the commandement, and tooke their leaue of the
Insuanto with great curtesie and reuerence, and with outward
shewes that they remained indebted for the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_109" id="Page_ii_109">[109]</a></span>
curtesie and good will that they had receiued: and therewith
they departed to the waters side, towards the boat
which was tarrying for them.</p>


<p>As they passed by the religious men (that before we spake
<span class="sidenote">Strange sacrifices.</span>
of) they saw a great table set, and vppon it a whole oxe with
his throte cut, and hard by the same a hogge and a goate,
and other thinges to bee eaten: the which they had ordained
for to make sacrifice, which they do vse in the like affaires.</p>

<p>They being imbarked in the boate, they were carried
aborde the Admirall, which was the shippe appointed for
them to go in: then presently they beganne to stirre the
shippe from one place unto another, with certain boates and
cables which they had there readie for the same purpose.
The shippe did not so soone begin to moue, but the religious
men a shore did beginne their sacrifice, the which did indure
vntill night, ending their feastes and triumphes in putting
forth of the cittie and vppon their gates, many cressets and
lights. The souldiers shot off all their hargabushes, and the
ships that were in the port shot off all their artilerie, and on
the shore a great noise of droms and bels: all the which
being ended and done, the Spaniards went a shore againe
vnto their lodging; but first the Insuanto was departed vnto
his owne house, with all the company that hee brought with
him.</p>

<p>The next day the sayd Insuanto did inuite them vnto a
banket, which was as famous as any which had bene made
them vnto that time. He was at the banquet himselfe, and the
captaine generall of all that prouince. There was aboundance
of meates, and many pretie deuises to passe away the
time, which made the banquet to indure more then foure
houres; the which being done, there was brought forth the
present which the Insuanto did sende vnto the gouernor of
Manilla, in returne of that which was sent to him. The
present was fourteene peeces of silke for the gouernor of
Manilla, and tenne peeces for the generall of the field: hee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_110" id="Page_ii_110">[110]</a></span>
also commanded to be giuen vnto the friers each of them
foure peeces, and vnto their seruants and slaues certaine
painted mantels, and therewith he tooke his leaue of them
very friendly, and gaue vnto them letters, the which hee
had wrote vnto the gouernor, and vnto the general of the
field, answere vnto those the which they had wrote vnto
him, and said that all things necessarie for their departure
was in a redinesse, with victuals for ten monethes put a bord
their ships, so that when as winde and wether did serue they
might depart. Also that if in their voyage it should so fall
out, that any of the Chinos that went in their shippes
shoulde do vnto them any euill, either abrode or at the
ilands, that the gouernor therof should punish them at his
pleasure, and how that the vizroy will thinke well thereof:
in conclusion he saide vnto them, that hee hoped to see them
there againe verie shortly, and to returne againe with Limahon,
and then hee woulde supplie the wantes which now
they lacked. The Spaniards did kisse his hands, and said,
that they had receiued in curtesie more then they deserued,
and that in all thinges there did abound and not lacke, that
they remained greatly indebted vnto him for their friendship,
and would giue their king notice thereof, that whensoeuer
occasion shoulde bee offered, to repay them with the
like: and therewith the Insuanto departed to his owne
house, leauing in the companie of the Spaniards fiue captaines,
those which should go with them in their company
to sea, and also Omoncon and Sinsay, who were that day in
the banquet, with the habite and ensigne of loytias, for that
the day before it was giuen vnto them by the Insuanto.</p>

<p>Upon Wednesday, which was the fourteenth of September,
the wind came faire, wherewith they hoised vp their
sailes and went to sea; at their departure there was at the
waters side the Insuanto and the iustice of Chincheo to see
them saile, the which Insuanto had conceiued so great loue
and friendship of the Castillas, that when he sawe them depart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_111" id="Page_ii_111">[111]</a></span>
he shedde great aboundance of teares, as was affirmed by
diuers Chinos that saw it; to which the Spaniards gaue
credit vnto, for that they knew him to be a maruellous
louing person, and humaine, of a good condition, and of a
gallant personage, and did exceede all other that they had
seene in all the time of their being in that prouince.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniardes departe from the port of Tansuso towardes the Ilandes
Philippinas, and euery day they doo harbor themselues in ilands by
the way; declaring what they saw in them.</i></p></div>


<p>Being departed out of the port as aforesaide, the Spaniards
deuided themselues into two shippes, to wit, the two
friers and Michael de Loarcha, Omoncon and three other
captaines in one shipp. And Peter Sarmiento, Nicholas de
Quenca, and Iohn de Triana, Sinsay, and all their souldiers,
in another ship, with eight other ships of warre, which went
with them for their safegard: they sailed forwards, directing
their course towards a small iland that was not farre off, with
determination there to take water for their ships, for that it
had in it many riuers of very sweete water. Within a smal
space they ariued there, and it had a very faire and sure
port, wherein might ride in securitie a great nauy of ships.
All Thursday they were there recreating and sporting themselues,
for that it was a pleasant ilande, and full of fresh
riuers. Uppon Friday, being the sixteenth of September,
the day being somewhat spent, they made saile and tooke
port foure leagues from that place, in another ilande called
Laulo, for to put themselues in a newe course different and
contrary vnto that which they brought when as they came
vnto that kingdome, for that the Chinos had by experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_112" id="Page_ii_112">[112]</a></span>
prooued, that in those monethes the windes were more fauourable
then in other monethes, and for the most part north
and northeast windes. Al that night they remained in that
iland, and the next day following they sailed vnto another
iland which was called Chautubo, not farre distant from that
of Laulo. This ilande was full of little townes, one of them
was called Gautin, which had fiue sortes of towers made of
lime and stone, verie thicke and strongly wrought: they
were all foure square, and sixe fatham high, and were made
of purpose for to receiue into them al the people of those
little townes, to defend themselues from rouers and theues
that daylie come on that coast. These fortes were made
with battlements, as we do vse, with space betwixt them:
and for that the forme and fashion of their building did like
them verie well, they were desirous to see if that within
them there were anie curious matter to bee seene; wherewith
they bent their artilerie towards them, and went a shore.
But when they which had the garde and keeping off did see
their comming, they did shut the gates, and woulde not consent
that they shoulde satisfie their desire, for any intreating
or promises that they could make.</p>

<p>They verie much noted, that although this ilande were
rocke and sandie, yet was it tilled and sowed full of rice,
wheate, and other seedes and graine. There was in it great

kine and horse.</span>
store of kine and horse, and they vnderstoode that they
were gouerned, not by one particular man, to whom they
were subject, neither by any other amongst themselues, nor
of China, but in common: yet notwithstanding they liued in
great peace and quietnesse, for that euerie one did content
himselfe with his owne. Uppon Sunday, in the afternoone,
they departed from this ilande, and sailed their course all
that night, and the next morning they ariued at another
iland called Corchu, which was twentie leagues from the
port of Tansuso, from whence they departed. The Spaniards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_113" id="Page_ii_113">[113]</a></span>
seeing what leasure they tooke in this their voyage,
they requested the captaines to commaunde the marriners
that they shoulde not enter into so many portes or harbors,
for that they had no certaintie of the weather, and not to
detract the time, but to take opportunitie before that contrarie
weather do come: for to saile in that order it seemed
more for recreation then to achiue or obtaine a voyage.
The captaines answered, and requested them to haue patience,
for that in making their iournies as they did, they
doo accomplish and follow the order set downe by the
vizroy and Insuanto, who did expressely commaunde them
with great charge for to direct their nauigation by those
ilands with great deliberation and consideration, because
they might in safetie and health ariue at Manilla.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_32" id="Footnote_1_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> Query misspelt for <i>maine</i>, from the old French word <i>maint</i>,&mdash;many.</p></div>

<p>The same day the north winde beganne to blowe verie
strongly: in such sort, that they thought it not good to go
forth of that harbor (as well for that aforesaid, to be commanded
<span class="sidenote">The Chinos are fearefull of the sea.</span>
to the contrarie), as also for that the Chinos are
very fearefull of the sea, and men that are not accustomed
to ingulfe themselues too farre, neither to passe anie stormes.</p>

<p>Neere vnto this iland there was another somewhat bigger,
which is called Aucon, wholly dispeopled and without anie
dwellers, yet a better countrie and more profitable for to
sowe and reape then that of Corchu. The Spaniards being
at an anker there, vnderstood by the Chinos that in times
past it was very well inhabited, vnto the which ariued a great
fleete belonging to the king of China, and by a great storme
were all cast away vpon the same: the which losse and destruction
being vnderstood by another general that had the
guard of that cost, suspecting that the dwellers thereof had
done that slaughter, he came to the shore and slew many of
the inhabitants, and caried all the rest in their ships vnto
the firme lande, who afterwards would neuer returne thither
againe, although they gaue them licence after that they
vnderstoode the truth of that successe: so that vnto that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_114" id="Page_ii_114">[114]</a></span>
time it remained dispeopled and full of wilde swine, of the
broode that remained there at such time as they were slaine
and caried away as you haue heard.</p>

<p>This iland and the rest adioyning thereunto (which are
very many) haue very excellent and sure ports and hauens,
with great store of fish. These ilands<a name="FNanchor_1_33" id="FNanchor_1_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> endured vntill they
came vnto a little gulfe, which is fiue and fortie leagues ouer,
and is sailed in one day, and at the ende thereof is the port
of Cabite, which before we haue spoken off, and is neere
vnto Manilla.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_33" id="Footnote_1_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_33"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The names of the various islands mentioned in this chapter are not
now recognizable.</p></div>

<p>So when that winde and weather serued their turne, they
departed from the ilande of Aucon, and sailed til they came
vnto another ilande called Plon, whereas they vnderstoode
by a shippe that was there a fishing, howe that the rouer
Limahon was escaped, wheras he was besieged at Pagansinan:
the manner and forme of the policie hee vsed therein
shalbe tolde you in the chapter following.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAP_I_XXXI" id="CHAP_I_XXXI"></a>CHAP. XXXI.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They haue newes how that the rouer Limahon was escaped, and howe that
he was in an ilande there hard by: some gaue iudgement to go and
set vpon him, but they resolued themselues to the contrarie, and follow
the voyage to Manilla.</i></p></div>


<p>Being at an anker in the iland of Plon, tarrying for a wind
to followe their voyage, with great desire to come thither
whereas they might vnderstande what had happened vnto
Limahon, at the same time entred into the saide harbor a
shippe with fishermen; they beleeuing that hee had beene
one of the ilands,<a name="FNanchor_2_34" id="FNanchor_2_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> they went vnto him and asked of whence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_115" id="Page_ii_115">[115]</a></span>
they were, and from whence they came, and what newes
they coulde say of Limahon (who was knowne vnto them all,
either by some harme that they had receiued, or else by
report of others that had receiued hurt). These fishermen
gaue them particular and whole relation, by the which they
vnderstoode that Limahon was fledde and not perceiued by
the Spaniards: he escaped in certaine barkes, the which he
caused to be made very secretlie within his forte, of such
timber and bords as remained of his shippes that were burnt,
the which was brought in by night by his souldiers, on that
side of the fort which was next vnto the riuer, and were not
discouered by the Castillas, which were put there with all
care and diligence to keepe the mouth, that no succour
might come in to helpe them. And towards the land there
whereas he might escape, they were without all suspection
(they were so strong), and did not mistrust that any such
thing shoulde bee put in vre, as afterwards did fal out, the
which was executed with so great policie and craft, that
when they came to vnderstande it, the rouer was cleane
gone and in sauegard, caulking his barkes at the iland of
Tocaotican, the better for to escape and saue himselfe, and
they saide that it was but eight dayes past that hee fledde.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_34" id="Footnote_2_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Islanders.</p></div>

<p>With this newes they all receiued great alteration, but in
especiall Omoncon and Sinsay, who returned vnto the Spaniards
and saide, that the escaping of the rouer is not without
some misterie, and that it coulde not bee done without the
will and knowledge of the Spaniards, and that the rouer had
giuen vnto the generall of the fielde some great gifts for to
let him go, for that otherwise it were a thing impossible for
him to escape, being besieged as hee was, although the
Spaniards had slept: the Spaniards did giue their discharge
in such prouable maner, that the captaines of China were
satisfied of the false opinion they had receiued, as afterwards
they were fully perswaded when they came to the cittie of
Manilla, and heard the generall of the fielde and other captaines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_116" id="Page_ii_116">[116]</a></span>
and souldiers that were at the siege. This iland of
Tocaotican whereas the rouer was mending and caulking of
his barkes, was distant from the iland of Plon, whereas the
Spaniards were, onely twelue leagues, and being by sea it
seemed to be lesse, for that very plainely you might see the
one ilande from the other. The which with the great cholor
that Omoncon and Sinsay had for the escaping of the rouer,
as also with the feare they receiued in that which might
happen vnto them by reason hereof at their returne vnto
China, which at the least might bee to take away (to their
great shame) the titles of loytias, which was giuen them in
that respect, did cause their stomakes and mindes to rise,
and to seeke occasion to go and fight with him, for that it
seemed vnto them they should get victorie with great ease,
for that hee was vnprouided and wearied with the long time
of his siege. Being in this determination there came vnto
them the captaine that was appointed generall ouer them,
and saide that the vizroy of Aucheo and the gouernor of
Chincheo had sent them onely to carrie those Spaniards vnto
Manilla, and to bring with him aliue or deade the rouer
Limahon, if they woulde giue him vnto them, and that hee
woulde not digresse from this order by no manner of meanes,
neither could they, if that they were so disposed, for that
the shippes were pestered with the horses: and againe, their
people they had brought with them, was more for to saile
and gouerne their shippes then for the fight. Moreouer the
fight would be verie dangerous, for that it was euident that
the rouer and his companions would rather be al slaine then
to yeelde themselues in any respect, and for to put such an
enterprise in effect, it were requisite to haue both ships and
men, and not to go so vnprouided and pestred as they were.
All which reasons being considered, they were all conformable
vnto the opinion of the generall, and determined that
so soone as winde and weather did serue, to set saile and to
passe the gulfe for to go vnto Manilla, whither as they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_117" id="Page_ii_117">[117]</a></span>
bound, and not to come vnto the ilande of Tocaotican
whereas the rouer was.</p>

<p>So after they had remained three weekes in that harbour
detained with a mightie north winde, that neuer calmed
night nor day in all that time, the eleuenth day of October,
two houres before day, they set saile and went to sea. By
reason of this great wind, there was not one shippe of all
those that were in the port of Plon coulde go foorth to giue
any notice vnto the rouer of the going of the Spaniards,
neither of the captaines of China. Sixteene leagues from
the port, sailing towards the south, they discouered a mightie
iland, verie high land, which was called Tangarruan, and
was of three score leagues about, all inhabited with people
like vnto those of the Ilands Philippinas: they passed hard
by it in the night, with a stiffe norwest winde, which was
the occasion that the shippe wherein the friers went was
constrained to go to sea; and the other nine, which were in
their companie for their safegarde, shrowded themselues
hard vnder the iland; by reason whereof they were so farre
separated the one from the other, that in the morning they
coulde not see them. They were in great danger, because
that night there was a great storme of winde, in the which
they lost the rudder of their shippe, and almost without any
hope to escape the fury thereof.</p>

<p>Being in this extremitie, they commended themselues with
contrite hearts vnto almightie God, and put their shippe
before the sea, vntill such time as they had supplied their
rudder, the which they did, although with great trauell and
labour: then straightwayes it was the will of God that this
contrary wind was somewhat calmed and his furie abated,
and a prosperous wind fauoured them, so that vppon Sunday,
in the morning, being the seuenteenth day of October,
they discouered the iland of Manilla, of them greatly desired,
yet could they not reach vnto it vntill Saint Simon
and Judes day: by reason that they returned backe vnto the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_118" id="Page_ii_118">[118]</a></span>
riuer of Pagansinan to seeke the other nine shippes, for that
it was concluded amongst them, that if it should so fall out,
they to be separated in any storme, that they should come
vnto that riuer, and to meete togither as they did.</p>

<p>So they departed from thence vnto the port of Buliano,
and not entring therin, the captaine Omoncon did set a man
on shore, one that could speake the language of that iland,
and gaue him charge to informe himselfe of all that had
happened with the rouer Limahon, for at that time he could
not beleeue that which had beene told him. Untill such
time as he returned, the shippes being without at the sea,
did play vnder fore sailes, who did declare vnto them the
verie same thing, the which was tolde them at the ilande of
Plon, without faultring any point: the which caused Omoncon
and Sinsay to receiue much more griefe then they did
when they heard the first newes, for as then they were
doubtfull of the truth. The Spanyards as then suspected that
they would haue returned vnto the firme land, and not haue
gone vnto Manilla, but to haue left them there all alone vpon
that iland. But it fell not out as they suspected: for although
that Omoncon and Sinsay did make an outward
shew to doo it, and sayde that they would sende the Spaniards
in a shippe, for that as then they were out of all danger, and
in sight of Manilla: yet was the generall of a contrarie
opinion, and sayd, that for no manner of occasion that might
happen, hee would not differ one point from the order which
was giuen vnto him; and therewith they sayled towards the
iland that they so long desired to see, and came thither the
twentie eight day of October, as aforesaid.</p>

<p>So that from the port of Tansuso, which is the first part of
China till they came vnto the iland of Manilla, they were
<span class="sidenote">From the Philippinas to the China is two
hundred leagues.</span>
fiue and fortie dayes, and is not in all full two hundred
leagues, which may bee made with reasonable wether in

things touching our holy Catholike faith, with great desire to receiue

<p>After that it was knowen vnto the gouernor of the citie of
Manilla and vnto the generall of the fielde, as also vnto the
rest of the captaines and souldiers, of the ariuall of the Spaniardes,

well for the particular loue they beare vnto them, as also for
to vnderstand and heare the newes from that mightie kingdome
of China, to be declared by witnesses of so great faith
and credite, they altogether went foorth to receiue them with
great ioye and pleasure, and likewise all such captaynes
and souldiers as came in their companie.</p>

<p>They were straightwaies conueighed vnto their lodginges
to rest themselues of their long iourney which they had by
sea, for it was requisite and needefull: for the which afterwardes
there was great feastes and bankets, which was made
by the gouernor, the generall of the field, and other particular
persons, vnto the Chinos, in recompence of that which
was done vnto the Spaniards in their countrie.</p>

<p>All which feastes did giue them little content when as
they did remember the flying and escape of the rouer; but
in especiall Omoncon and Sinsay, who continually and euery
moment did call vpon the generall of their fleete to make
haste and to shorten the time that they might depart from
the firme land, where giuing notice vnto the gouernor of
Chincheo of the estate of Limahon, he might giue order that
before he had reedified and repayred himselfe they might
take him (which is a thing most desired in all that kingdome).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_120" id="Page_ii_120">[120]</a></span>
The generall was verie glad and reioyced of their
good intertainment, and answered vnto Omoncon and Sinsay,
saying that by reason of the great storme and foule weather
past, their ships had great neede of reparation, and likewise
the mariners to ease themselues, the which being done he
would with all his heart depart.</p>

<p>The generall of the fielde was verie sorrowfull and much
greeued for that the rouer Limahon was so escaped, and the
more when he vnderstoode that he was suspected that hee
did consent vnto his departure: for which occasion, if that
the captaynes had not beene verie much wearied with the
long siege, and euill weather which happened in that time,
without all doubt he would haue followed him, and neuer to
haue left him till he had taken or slaine him.</p>

<p>Although they were fully perswaded that Limahon was so
terrified with the great perill and danger in the which he was,
and againe with so small number of people, that rather hee
would desire to put himselfe in securitie then to offende or
doo any harme, neyther to put himselfe in any place whereas
hee might receiue damage of any of them to whom hee had
doone so open wrong (who were so much desirous to be
reuenged), who for to preuent all that might happen (as after
we vnderstoode), hauing made readie his barkes and boates
which he ordayned in his fort, and put in them victualles
for their iourney, he departed with his small number of
people vnto an ilande farre off and unknowen, there whereas
he vnderstoode that none would goe to seeke him, and there
hee remayned a time whereas he fell sicke of a melancholike
infirmitie, which grewe by an imagination that hee had
to remember in what state he was at that time, and howe he
had seene himselfe at other times feared throughout al the
kingdome of China, which was an imagination sufficient for
to bring him to his ende: his companions were dispersed
abroad, so that we neuer heard more of them.</p>

<p>Now returning to our purpose, after that the China
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_121" id="Page_ii_121">[121]</a></span>
captaines had recreated them selues with the feastes and
sportes that was made vnto them, and taken recreation many
dayes, and tarryed, hoping that the weather would proue
fayrer to prepare themselues to depart. In the same time
they did intreat of many thinges in particular touching
Christian religion, whereof with great care they did informe
themselues of our religious men, and tolde them some secret
things that were unknowen vnto them of their countrie, for
that they were strangers.</p>

<p>So when as time and weather did serue, they did take
their leaue, with many signes and tokens of griefe for to
depart and leaue the conuersation of so good companions,
and did promise vnto them to procure all that was possible
that the friendshippe begunne betwixt them and the Chinos
should continue and perseuer, for that it was a thing that
did content them all.</p>

<p>Their generall himself did take this particular charge vnto
himselfe, with a determinate purpose for to declare in effect
to the gouernour of Aucheo (whose private seruant he was)
the good meaning of the Castillos; and what principall
people they were, and the ceremonies they vsed, with the
which hee was marueilously in love. Likewise hee would giue
him to vnderstande of the flying of the rouer Limahon, how
and in what manner and order it was, and how that the
generall of the field and the other captaines were in no fault
thereof. This he would do, in respect that if it should so
fall out that Omoncon and Sinsay, for their owne credite,
should declare any thing against the Spaniardes that was not
true, that they might not be beleeued.</p>

<p>Besides all this he tolde the gouernour certaine thinges in
secret, how they might with great ease purchase the friendship
they pretended. And amongest them all, one was, that
hee should make a supplication vnto the Catholike king in
requesting him to write a letter vnto their king, and sende
him embassador, and such as shoulde giue vnto them the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_122" id="Page_ii_122">[122]</a></span>
light of the Catholike and Christian faith, with the which
diligence there was no doubt that not onely the friendshippe
betwixt the kinges and their subiectes shoulde bee
established, but also the king and all his kingdome would
<span class="sidenote">The Papists and the Infidels
ceremonies much alike.</span>
receiue the Catholike faith, for that there are manye ceremonies
vsed amongest them which doo much resemble those
of our Christian religion; and againe in their liuing morally,
they doo obserue in manie thinges the Tenne Commandements
of Gods lawe, of the which in particular he did
informe himselfe: so that the greatest difficultie was in the
entring in of the preaching of the holy gospell, and beeing
by this meanes ouer come, in a short time all the whole
kingdome would turne Christians. And considering that in
their worshipping, as they doo worship all thinges in the
seconde essence, with great facilitie they would change their
adoration and giue it vnto the first, as most worthie, and
vnto whom it is their duties. The generall did adde more
thereunto, and saide that he was so much affectioned vnto
the faith of the Christians, that if it were not that he should
be banished and loose his countrie, house and landes, without
all doubt he would haue beene baptised: the which he
could not doo without loosing of all, for that they haue a
law in their countrie, the which is obserued and kept inuiolably,
by the which it is forbidden that none whatsoeuer
can receiue any strange religion differing from theirs vpon
paine of death, without the consent of the king and his
counsell.</p>

<p>This law was made to take away nouelties, and to liue all
in one vniformitie of religion, with one manner of rites and
ceremonies.</p>

<p>This only was the occasion that certaine marchants of
China, being affectioned vnto the law of the gospell, were
baptised at the Philippinas, and there do dwell at this day
in the citie of Manilla amongest the Spaniardes, and are
become verie good Christians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_123" id="Page_ii_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>So with these offers, and with promises to be great friendes
vnto the Spaniardes, the generall departed from Manilla to
goe vnto the firme lande, and with him the other captaynes
Omoncon and Sinsay, with great hope that verie shortly they
should be all of one faith. So the one tooke their leaue of
the other with reasons of great affection and tokens of great
loue, signifying that in any thing that should be offered they
should finde them friendly.</p>

<p>They being departed, the Spaniardes remayned verie carefull
in praying vnto the diuine maiestie, desiring of Him to
direct all thinges in this their request, that it might be to his
holy seruice, and also to inspire the Catholike maiestie of King
Phillip their lorde for to sende his embassador vnto the king
of China, offering his friendship, and to admonish him to
receiue the faith of Christ, the which according vnto the
report of the Austen fryers that entred into that countrie (of
whom we haue made mention manie times in this booke with
their companions), and also the generall of China tolde them
that there was no other means but only that for to bring
their purpose to effect.</p>

<p>This counsell with all the speede possible they put in vre,
and sent vnto his maiestie one of purpose, and in the name
of all them of those ilandes to request him, and to declare
how much it did import. They sent vnto him this relation,
with manie particular persons, for to mooue his most Christian
minde for to sende an embassador, as in effect hee did,
in that sort as hath beene tolde you in the last chapter of the
thirde booke of this historie, whereas it is declared in particular,
and in what estate it doth remaine vnto this day.
God for his mercies sake direct all thinges, that it may be to
his seruice and glorie, and the saluation of so many soules.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The fryers of Saint Francis came vnto the Ilandes Philippinas, and
procured to passe vnto the firme lande of the kingdome of China, with
zeale to preach the holy gospell.</i></p></div>


<p>The day of the visitation of our Ladie, in the yeare 1578,
there came out of Spaine to the citie of Manilla, in the Ilandes
Philippinas, the father Fryer Peter de Alfaro, who went for
Costodio of that prouince, and fourteene more other religious
persons of the same order in his companie, and were sent
by the king of Spaine and his royall counsel of the Indias,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_126" id="Page_ii_126">[126]</a></span>
for to be ayders and helpers of the Austen fryers, who vntill
that time had beene there alone in those ilandes, occupied in
the conuerting of the people in that countrie, and were the
first ministers of the gospell, preaching the same with great
zeale, vnto the profite of their soules: of the which people
those fryers had baptised (when the others ariued) more
then one hundred thousande, and the rest prepared and
cathecised to receive the like. Because that at the first
occasion that might be giuen, they might enter into the
kingdome of China to preach the holy gospell. The which
Fryers, when that they had been there the space of one yeare
occupying themselues in the same exercise in preaching and
conuerting the people of that countrie, in the same time
they were giuen to vnderstande by the relation of the selfe
same Austen fryers, as also by many marchants of China
which came vnto them with marchandice, of things to be
wondred at of that mightie kingdome, and of the infinite
number of soules which the diuell had deceiued and brought
vnto his seruice with false idolatrie. The which being by
them well vnderstood, they did burne with great zeale and
desire of their saluation, and to goe and preach the gospell,
although it were to put their persons in whatsoeuer hazarde
or danger.</p>

<p>So with this their great desire, they did many and diuerse
times communicate with the gouernor that was there at that
time for his maiestie, who was called the Doctor Francisco
de Sandi, desiring his fauour and licence for to goe vnto
China in the companie of certaine marchants of that countrie,
that were at that present in the port with their ships, offering
themselues to get their good will, although it were to
offer themselues to be slaues or otherwise whatsoeuer. And
seeing that at all such times when as they did intreat of
that matter, they found him but luke warme, and that he
did (as it were) but to detract the time, and feed them with
hope: then they calling to minde that the chiefest intent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_127" id="Page_ii_127">[127]</a></span>
and cause of their comming out of Spayne, was to enter into
that kingdome, caused a newe desire to grow in them, what
with the contractation they had with the sayde Chinos, as
well in conuersation as in talke, and finding them to be a
people of great abilitie and discretion, and of verie good
iudgements, the which did greatly content their desire, they
did perswade themselues that it was an easie matter to make
them to vnderstande the things appertaining vnto God. So
that they determined to put other remedies in practise, because
that which they required with the good will of the
gouernor, seemed to be a large and long matter. So it happened
that vpon a time intreating of this matter, and hauing
requested of God with great instance for to direct them the
readie way which was best for his seruice, and for the profite
of those soules, there came to the Ilandes Philippinas a
Chino, who, according as they did vnderstand, was one of
the priests and religious men of that kingdome (of the which
priests there are a great number in euerie towne): this
priest went diuerse times vnto the monasterie of the Fryers,
and did common with them of the creation of the worlde and
other things, which did open the way that they might declare
vnto him thinges appertayning vnto God, vnto the
which he did hearken with great good will. And after that
hee had declared vnto them in particular the mightinesse
and secretes of this mightie kingdome of China (whose conuersion
they so greatly desired), he very inquisitiuely asked
of them matters touching the Christian faith, of whome
within a fewe dayes after he desired to be baptised, for that
he would be a Christian, being instructed before in many
matters touching our Catholike faith.</p>

<p>Our religious men did accomplish his desire, the which
was an incredible ioy vnto all the dwellers of the citie, and a
content vnto himselfe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_128" id="Page_ii_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>So after that he was made a Christian hee remayned in the
monasterie amongest the other, but yet would he neuer eate
any other thing but colde herbes: and he seeing that all the
<span class="sidenote">The Spaniards rise at their midnight
mattens and whip themselues.</span>
religious men did arise vp at midnight to mattens and discipline
themselues, spending the greatest part of the night in
prayer before the holy sacrament, hee did not faile one
point, but did imitate them in all their dooings, with outwarde
showes of a verie good will. All the which did
incyte the Fryer Costodio and all the rest of his companions
to put in execution their great desire they had, according as
it hath beene tolde you. Whereupon he went once againe
vnto the gouernour to intreat him by faire meanes that which
before they had comoned with him of, and that he would
procure some order or meanes, that those religious men
might go to the kingdome of China to preach the lawe of
God, offering himselfe to be one of them, with protestation
that if he would not giue them leaue, they would procure
to go without it, with that authoritie the which hee had of
God and of his superiors, for to teach and instruct these
poore infidels their neighbors: and this should be done with
the first opportunitie they might finde or haue.</p>

<p>But neither this, nor yet the example of that good Chino,
which was newe christened, was sufficient to perswade the
gouernor to consent vnto their request; but perseuering in
his first opinion, he answered and said, that it was too
timely, and that the friendship which they had with the
Chinos as yet was very small, and how that the fathers of
S. Austen had manie times attempted the entrie into that
kingdome, and yet neuer could obtaine their desire. And
howe that the Chinos that did carrie them did deceiue them,
and left them in certaine ilands, till such time as they heard
farther newes of the rouer Limahon, and of the returne of
the captaine Omoncon, who did carrie them with the good
newes of the straight siege in the which they had the rouer:
and yet for all that they commanded them to returne from
Aucheo, without giuing them anie licence to remaine in the
countrie to preach the holy gospell; and nowe to attempt the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_129" id="Page_ii_129">[129]</a></span>
same, was but to giue occasion vnto the Chinos euerie day
to mocke and make a iest of the Spaniardes, and willed them
to staye till such time as it were the will of God to giue way
vnto the same, which could not be long.</p>

<p>This Fryer Costodio vnderstanding the answere of the
gouernour, perseuering still in his first opinion, and did not
goe about to seeke any meanes to accomplish their desire for
the entring into the firme lande, hee straightwayes beganne
secretly to procure by all meanes possible to attempt and
accomplish that iourney, although it were without the order
and consent of the gouernour (when that it might not be
doone otherwise), the which incontinent they beganne to put
in vre, for that the Fryer Costodio and Fryer Steuen Ortiz
(who was a religious man, that for the great desire he had
did learne the China tongue, and at that time did speake it
resonablie), they both together did giue to vnderstande of
their desire and pretence vnto a deuout souldier of their
religion, and one that they made great account of, who was
called Iohn Dias Pardo, who often times had made manifest
vnto them and saide, that he had a great desire to do some
especiall seruice vnto God, although it were to hazarde his life
in the same, who at that instant did accomplish his desire,
and did promise them to beare them companie vnto the death.</p>

<p>So with this conformitie they went straightwayes altogether
to speake with a captaine of China that was in the same
port, in a shippe of his owne, who many times did repayre
vnto their conuent, to aske of them thinges appertayning
vnto God, and the heauens, with showe of a very good
vnderstanding, who vnto their iudgement did consent and
accept all with great pleasure and delight.</p>

<p>Unto this captayne they did giue to vnderstande the effect
of all their desire, requesting him of his ayde and helpe in
the prosecuting of the same. Who straightwayes did offer
himselfe to accomplish their request and to carrie them vnto
China, so as they woulde then giue him some thing for to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_130" id="Page_ii_130">[130]</a></span>
bestowe amongest his marriners. The souldier Iohn Diaz
Pardo did promise to giue them all that they would aske,
and gaue them in earnest certayne ryalles of plate. And for
that all thinges shoulde bee doone in good order, and in such
sort that the gouernour nor any other shoulde haue any suspition
or knowledge, it was ordayned amongest them that
the captaine of China should with all speede dispatch himselfe
and depart to the port of Bindoro, which is twentie
leagues from the citie of Manilla, and there to tarrie for
them, and to carrie in his companie the Chino that was new
baptised as aforesaid.</p>

<p>The captaine made haste, dispatched himselfe, and departed
vnto the port appointed, and within a fewe dayes
after the father Costodio and his company, with the souldier
his friend, did followe them. But when they came thether
they found the captaine Chino in an other mind, in such
sort that neyther gifts nor faire intreatie was sufficient to
perswad him to performe that which he had promised in
Manilla, but returned vnto them their earnest before receiued,
affirming that for any thing in al the world he would
not carrie them, for that he knewe very well, if hee should
so doo, it would cost him his life and goods.</p>

<p>The newe baptised religious Chino seeing that, wept
bitterly, with discontentment to see how the diuell had
changed the minde of the captaine, for that in that kingdome
the holie gospell should not be preached. The father
Costodio did resolue himselue to returne vnto Manilla, and
there to abide a better oportunitie, as in effect they did,
whereas they remayned certaine dayes, till such time it happened
as followeth.</p>

<p>Upon a day the gouernour sent and called vnto him the
father Costodio, and requested of him that he would let him
haue some Fryer for to sende vnto the riuer of Cagayan,
whether not long before he had sent certaine Spaniards for
to inhabite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_131" id="Page_ii_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fryer Costodio promised him one, and that he should
go with him in companie till he came to the prouince of
Illocos whether he went, and that from thence he would
dispatch him vnto the riuer of Cagayan, according vnto his
worships commandement, requesting of him to haue in his
companie, to keepe watch and warde in that iourney, the
ensigne Francisco de Duennas, and Iohn Diaz Pardo the
souldier, his friend as aforesaide, with pretence to depart
from thence vnto China, as in effect they did, as shall be
tolde you. The gouernor being very willing for to pleasure
him, did grant his request. So with great speede he departed,
and carried with him the foresaide souldiers, and for
companion a religious man called frier Austin de Tordesillas
(he who afterwards did put in memorie all thinges that
passed with them in China), out of the which hath beene
taken this small relation.<a name="FNanchor_1_35" id="FNanchor_1_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> So when they came vnto the
Illocos, they found fryer Iohn Baptista and fryer Sebastian,
of S. Francis, of his owne order, occupied in the teaching
and instructing the people of that prouince, which was
the fourth day of Iune.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_35" id="Footnote_1_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> The friar Augustin de Tordesillas was one of the founders of the
province of St. Gregory in Luzon. His narrative seems never to have
been printed elsewhere. See Sbaralea's <i>Supplement</i> to Waddington, and
N. Antonio's <i>Bibliotheca Hispana Nova</i>.</p></div>

<p>The next day following they called a counsell, where it
was concluded that all those that were there present would
venture themselues for to go vnto China, to conuert those
gentiles, or else to die in the quarrell. And the better to
bring their purpose to passe, they thought it good to speake
vnto an other souldier that was there with them, called
Pedro de Villa Roel, not telling vnto him their pretence,
because they would not be discouered (but asked him in this
manner) if he would beare him companie, and the other two
souldiers, who altogether went about a business of great
honour and seruice of God, and the benefite and sauing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_132" id="Page_ii_132">[132]</a></span>
manye soules; and that he would declare vnto them whether
he would go or not, without asking whether nor from what
place, for that as then they could not giue him to vnderstand,
till time did serue. His answere was, that straightwaies
he would beare them companie, and would neuer
leaue them to death.</p>

<p>So foorthwith they altogether with singular ioy went to
the ship wherin the father Costodio and his companion, with
the other two souldiers, came in from Manilla to that place
with a reasonable frigat, although with but fewe marriners,
and they not verie expert. So being altogether in the
shippe, with all such thinges as they could get together in
that small time for their prouision in that iourney, they
made all thinges in a readinesse to set sayle the same day,
which was the twelfth day of the said moneth of Iune. So
after they had sayde masse and commended themselues vnto
God, requesting Him to direct their voyage that it might be
to His glorie and seruice, they set sayle vppon a Fryday, in
the morning, with intent to goe foorth of that port; but they
could not by no meanes possible, for that the sea went verie
loftie vpon the barre, and contending with the sea for to get
foorth they were in great danger to haue beene cast away,
which was the occasion that with great sorrow they returned
into the port, whereas they remayned all day.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The fryers and their companions depart from the port of Illocos, after
they had committed vnto God the direction of their voyage. They
passe great daungers and troubles, and do ouercome them all with the
confidence they haue in God, and came vnto the kingdome of China
miraculously.</i></p></div>


<p>[Early in the morning of the following day (being the
festival of St. Antony of Padua), they said mass and returned
to the frigate to take their departure; but the sea was still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_133" id="Page_ii_133">[133]</a></span>
so boisterous and rough that it took the ship on her broad-side,
and she leaked very much, until at length it pleased
God that she drove on the shore, where, striking on the
sand several times, it was a most evident miracle that she did
not go to pieces, and that all in her were not drowned. It
was their firm belief that God had done this through the
intercession of the blessed St. Anthony, whose day it was,
and to whom they had with sincere devotion commended
themselves. They then put back from the river which they
had left, and this they accomplished, but with great exertion
and danger, insomuch that the Father Stephen Ortiz became
so terrified, that no persuasion could induce him to continue
the voyage which they had started upon: He replied that
he would not further tempt God, since the signs which they
had seen were sufficient to show that it was not His holy
will that they should prosecute that journey at that time, the
which proved a trouble and stumblingblock to all the rest.
The Father Costodio concealed his vexation and put a good
face on the matter, telling them all to keep up their
courage, for that great difficulties attended every good
work at the commencement, but that these easily yielded to
perseverance and patience, as experience had often shown.
In this manner he talked with them until the day of the
Trinity, when, after the priests had said mass and confessed
the laymen, and administered the sacrament to them, they
all returned with good will to go on board, except the above-mentioned
Father Ortiz, who remained at home in his old
obstinacy, and with him the Chinese who had been baptized,
the latter having fallen very ill, which caused great grief
to all.]<a name="FNanchor_1_36" id="FNanchor_1_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>So the next day, after they had committed themselues to
God with great deuotion, they embarked themselues and
made sayle, and by the will of God they went out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_134" id="Page_ii_134">[134]</a></span>
harbour, although with great danger; and they carryed with
them an other barke a sterne their ship, in the which they
did determine for to set a lande such Indians as they carried
with them from the Esquipazon,<a name="FNanchor_1_37" id="FNanchor_1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> to helpe them out of the
harbour: the which they did not for feare they should be
drowned. So when they were out of that riuer, they sayled
towards the little iland that was but one league from that
place, and there they put the Indians a shore, and with them
a young man, a Spaniard, that they brought from Manilla to
serue them. So those which should go on that voyage remayned
there the same night, who were the frier Costodio;
frier Peter de Alfaro, borne in Siuel; frier Iohn Baptista,
borne in Pesaro in Italy; fryer Sebastian de San Francisco,
of the citie of Boecia;<a name="FNanchor_2_38" id="FNanchor_2_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and frier Augustin de Tordesillas, of
the same towne whereof he hath his name; all these foure
were priestes of the masse.</p>

<p>The fryer Costodio would with a very good will haue
carried more of them, but he durst not for two causes; the
one for that hee would not haue beene discouered, and the
other (which was the principal occasion), because he would
not leaue that prouince of the Illocos without such as shold
instruct them, whereas were many baptized: for which
respect he left some behind him, which afterwarde hee would
have beene very glad that they had beene in his companie.
There were three Spaniards souldiers that did beare them
companie, the one was called the ancient Francisco de
Duennas, of Velez Malaga&mdash;the other John Diaz Pardo, of
Saint Lucas de Barameda, the third Pedro de Villa Roel of
the citie of Mexico. Besides these they had a boy of China
who could speak the Spanish tongue, and was one of them
that were taken at the siege of Limahon the rouer, and
other foure Indians of Manilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_135" id="Page_ii_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>They departed from this little islande upon a Munday,
the first quarter in the morning which was the fifteene day
of the said moneth of June, and sayled that way so nigh as
they could gesse to be the way vnto China, without pilot or
any other certaintie, more than that which God did shewe
and put into their minds with their great desire, which
seemed vnto them to comprehende and bring it to passe.
This day the winde was contrarie and against them, which
was the occasions that they sayled but little. Towardes the
evening, the winde changed and blewe at the north (the
which winde vppon that coast is very dangerous), which
made them greatly afrayde; yet was that feare driven away
by an other feare much greater than that, which was that they
should be discovered, and that they should be pursued by
the commandemente of the governour of Manilla, for which
occasion whereas they should have throwed themselves under
the land, they wrought contrary and cast about vnto the sea
in great danger to have beene cast away; but it was the will
of God that when as night came, the winde did calme (which
commonly falleth out to the contrary), but the sea remayned
very rough and loftie, that they thought verily to have beene
drowned with the furie thereof, for it tossed the frigetta in
<span class="sidenote">They were in great perill.</span>
such sort, that it seemed a whole legion of diuels had taken
holde on both sides of the shippe, forcing the one against the
other that it rowled in such sort that many times the halfe
decke was in the water, so that the mariners could not stand
upon their feete, but were driven to sustaine themselves by
the ropes and cables. But the religious men trusting in God,
whose zeale had caused them this great trouble, did pray and
desire him with many tears, that hee would deliver them out
of the same daunger, and not to give place vnto the diuell for
to disturbe them of their voyage and enterprise.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote">The Fryers vsed certaine coniurations
for that S. Antonie was a sleepe.</span>
These their orations and prayers did so much prevaile,
with certaine coniurations which they made against the
diuels, (who they thought they did see visibly), that after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_136" id="Page_ii_136">[136]</a></span>
midnight the north winde ceased and began to blowe at the
north east, with the which the sea began to waxe calme; so
that they might make their way to be east north east, for that
they had intelligence that that course was the shortest cut to
the firme land. This winde which was so favourable vnto
them, did increase so much in two hours that the sea waxed
loftie and caused them to forget the sorrowe past, and constrained
them (for that the shippe was but small) to cut their
mast ouer borde, and to put themselves vnto the courtesie of
the sea with little hope to escape the danger. But our
Lorde whose zeale did moove them to attempt that iourney,
did direct their voyage in such sort, that the next day following
it came to be calme in such sort that they might set up a
newe mast, in the place of that which was cut ouer borde in
the storme, and therewith to nauigate forwardes with their
begunne voyage. So upon the Fryday following at the
break of the day they sawe lande, and thinking that it had
beene the firme land of China they gave thanks unto God,
and rejoiced, in such sort that they had cleane forgotten the
troubles of the stormes and foule weather passed, so they
made towards it and came thither about noone, but when
they were a shore, they found that it was but a small island
and situated foure leagues from the firme land; and for that
it was so nigh, a farre off it seemed to be all one thing. But
when they came unto this ilande they did discover many ships
which were so many in number that it seemed all the sea to
be covered with them. The friers, with the great desire
they had for to knowe in what port they were, they comanded
to gouerne their ship towards whereas they were, who when
they saw them, and could not know them by the strangenes
of their ship and sailes, they did fly from them all that ever
they could. The which our men perceiving and could not
imagine the cause thereof, they were very much agrieued and
sorrowful, and the more for that they could not learne nor
vnderstand where they were. But seeing nigh vnto them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_137" id="Page_ii_137">[137]</a></span>
to the lewarde three ships, they made towards them, and
when they were somewhat nigh they put themselves as the
others did. In this sort they spent all the rest of the day in
going from one port to an other vnto those ships, for to
informe themselves where they were; but all this diligence
prevailed them nothing at all till it was almost sunne set.
They entred with their frigat into a gut vnder the shore,
whereas fell from a high rocke which was more than one
hundredth fatham by estimation, a stream of water which
was as bigge as the bodies of two men together.</p>

<p>In this gut there was three other ships, and they came to an
anker in the middest amongest them, the which beeing done
they asked of them what countrie that was, but they answered
nothing, nor made any semblance, but looked the one upon
the other; and in beholding of the Spaniards they gave
great laughters. In this gut they remained all that night,
almost amased to see how those people were, as though they
were enchanted; and they without any light of their desire,
which was to knowe where they were. So the next day
folowing (which was Saterday), very early in the morning
they set sayle, and went amongst a great sort of islandes,
always bearing vnto them, which they thought to be the
firme lande, being greatly amarueiled to see the infinite
number of shippes both great and small that they sawe;
some were a fishing, and some under sayle, and other some
ryding at an anker. The same day about noon there happened
unto them a strange and miraculous thing, and it
was, that passing through a straight that was but a quarter
of a league of bredth, which was betwixt the firme lande and
a small islande, in the which was continually four score
ships of warre set there for watch and warde; they passed
through the thickest of them and were never seene, for if
they hadde, without all doubt they had sonke them or slain
them. Their order and commission is so straight given them
by their generalles of the sea, in the which they are commanded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_138" id="Page_ii_138">[138]</a></span>
that whatsoever kinde of people of strange nations
that they do meete upon the coast, for to kill them or sinke
them, except they do bring licence from some governor of
such cities as be upon the coast; for that such as doo meane
to have traficke doo sende to demand the same, leaving their
ships a great way at sea.</p>

<p>This lawe for to watch and warde was made and ordayned
(as they do say), in respect of the Japones who did enter into
certain of their portes, dissembling themselues to be Chinos;
being apparelled as they were, and speaking their language,
they did vnto them great and strange hurtes and damages,
as is declared in the booke before this. So when they were
passed this straight, they sayled almost sixe leagues forwardes
into a verie fayre and great bay, following other shippes that
went before them; for that it seemed that they would enter
into some port, and there they might informe themselues
where they were, which was the thing that they most desired.
When they had sayled about two leagues in this bay, they
overtook one of the three shippes, and asked of the people
that were within her (by the intrepreter they had with them),
whether they sayled, and what lande that was which they
sawe before them.</p>

<p>Then the principall that was in that ship, did put himself
into his boat the which hee had at sterne, and came vnto the
ship where the Spaniards were, the better to vnderstande
what they did demand; for they before by reason that they
were somewhat farre off the one from the other, could not
vnderstande the Spaniards demand but by signes. So when
that he vnderstoode their request, he answered them that it
was the country of China, and how that he came laden with
salt from the citie of Chincheo, and went to make sale thereof
vnto the citie of Canton, which was so nigh hand that they
might ariue there before night. But when that he was
entred into the Spanish ship and saw the friers and the rest
that were in their companie, and saw that their apparell and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_139" id="Page_ii_139">[139]</a></span>
speech was strange vnto him, he asked of them what they
were and from whence they came, and whether they went?
(and when that he vnderstood that they were Castillos, and
of the islands Philippinas, and came from the said islands
and were bound vnto China, with intent to preach the holy
gospell), he asked them whose licence they had to conduct
them vnto the firme lande? But when he vnderstood that
they had none, hee asked them howe they passed and escaped
the fleete of ships that was in the straight aforesayde? The
Spaniards answered, that they found no impediment nor let.
So he being greatlie amazed as well of the one as of the other,
entered into his owne boate, and with great furie departed
from their shippe and went into his owne; but at his
departure the Spaniards did request him that he would
conduct them vnto the citie, who gave them to vnderstande
by signes that he woulde, although he feared the rigorous
punishment that in that kingdom is executed vppon all such
as doo bring into the same any man of a strange nation (as
hath been tolde you in the first part of this historie.) So hee
fearing that if hee shoulde enter with him into the port, the
fault would be imputed unto him, therefore at such time
as hee came within halfe a league of the riuer's mouth, he
cast about his shippe and sailed to sea, and went so farre that
in a short time the Spaniards had lost the sight of them; who
when they saw that they had no guide, they followed the
course of another shippe that they had discovered before the
other did cast about to sea, for which occasion the other two
ships that we spake off before were departed. So a little
before the sunne set, they discouered the mouth and entrie
of a great and mightie brode riuer, out of the which came
two great streames or armes, and in them many ships entering
in and going forth; and considering how they had the winde
which serued them well they entered into the same. But
when they had sailed forwards a quarter of a league, they
discouered so great a multitude of barkes that it seemed vnto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_140" id="Page_ii_140">[140]</a></span>
them a grove, or some inhabited place, and as we drew nigh
vnto them, they not knowing our shippe, all began to flie and
run away with so great noise, as though they should haue
beene all set on fire or smoke in that place. The Spaniards
seeing that they were the occasion of this feare amongst them,
they withdrew themselves into the middest of the riuer,
whereas they strooke saile and came to an anker, and there
they did ride all that night, and it was in such a place that
none of al the other barks and boats came nigh them by a
great way.</p>

<p>The next day following, which was Sunday, the one-and-twentieth
day of June, they weighed anker, and went vnder
their foresaile vp that arme of the riuer, the which within a
little while they had sailed did ioine with the other arme
aforesaide, and was in that place of so great widenesse that
it seemed to bee a sea; there sailed in and out many shippes,
barkes, and boates, of whom the Spaniards demaunded how
farre the port was off from that place, but they answered nothing
at all, but with great laughter and wonder to see the Spaniards
and their kind of attyre, they departed. But when they had
sailed two leagues up the riuer, they discouered a high towre
and very faire, vnder the which were at an anker a great
number of shippes; thither they sailed right on. So when
as they came right ouer against the towre, they saw on shore
a great mighty crane, to discharge merchandize withal,
whereat lay many ships; but when they came to the point,
fearing that some ordinance would be shot at them, they
strook all their sailes, according vnto the vse and custom in
the ports of Spain. They, after a while that they had remained
in that sort, and saw that neither the towre nor the
ships did make any motion towards them, they turned and
hoised up again their sailes and went wheras al the ships
were, and when they came amongst them they let fall their
anker; wheras they did ride, looking when they would come
to demand of them anything.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The fryers and their companions came vnto the cittie of Canton, they went
on shore, and praised God for that it had pleased Him to let them see
their desire fulfilled. There comes a iustice to visite them, and hath
with them great communication.</i></p></div>


<p>The Spaniards seeing that they were there at an anker a
good while, and that there was none that came vnto them to
demand any question, they hoisted out their boate, and went
in it on shore, wheras they al kneeled downe upon their
knees, and with great deuotion did say <i>Te Deum laudamus</i>,
giuing thankes to God for that he had so myraculously
brought them into the kingdome of China, of them so much
desired, without any pilot or other humane industrie; the
which being doone, they began to walke along by the crane
aforesaid, nigh unto the which were certaine houses wheras
were kept ropes and tackling belonging vnto the shippes; so
they proceeded forwards with intent to seek the gates of the
citie, the which after they had gone the space of foure hargabus
shot, they found the gate, which was verie great and
sumptuous of a strong and gallant edifice. The people of
the country seeing them at their comming a shore how they
did kneele downe, and how that their manner of attire was
different from the people of the same, and not knowing from
whence they did come, did cause in them great admiration,
and to ioyne togither a great troope of people, and followed
them with great desire to see the end of their enterprize.</p>

<p>This great multitude of people was the occasion that they
entered in at the gates of the cittie without being
discouered of the guards and posts that were put there for
that purpose, neither were they disturbed of the entry by
reason of the great throng of people and strangenesse of
the matter. So after they had gone a while in the streete,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_142" id="Page_ii_142">[142]</a></span>
the people increasing more and more to see them, they
staied in the porch of a great house there, where as the
iustices of the sea, or water bailies, do keepe their courts of
audience; and in the meane time that they remained there,
which was a pretty while, the guardes of the gate understood
that amongst the presse and throng of the people, did enter
certaine strangers, contrary to the precept given them vpon
great penalties; they straightway, with great fear that their
ouersight should be discouered, ran and laid hands vpon the
Spaniards, and carried them backe againe and put them out
of the gate of the citie, without doing any evil or harme vnto
their persons, and willed them to stay there in that place till
such time as they had given the gouernor of the cittie to vnderstand
thereof, and he to send them licence that they may
enter in againe. So after a good while that they had remained
there wheras the guards had set them, there came
vnto them a man who was a Chino, called Canguin, and
could speake Portugal, who knowing them to be Christians
by their faces and attire, did aske them in the Portugal
toong, what they sought? the Spaniards answered him,
that their comming into that kingdom was for to shew and
declare to them the way to heaven, and to give them to
vnderstand and know the true God, the creator of heaven
and earth, and that they would very faine talke with the
gouernor to entreat therof. This Chino by and by brought
to them a man that could speak very good Portuges, who as
after they did vnderstand, both he, his wife and children
were christened; and although they were borne in China, yet
did they dwel thre years with Portugals that were inhabited
in Machao, which is twenty leagues from that cittie of Canton.
This did demande the same question of them that the other
did, and wherefore they came into that countrie? They
answered him the same as they did the other; hee replied,
and asked them who was the pilot that brought them thither?
they answered, the will of God; they not knowing howe, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_143" id="Page_ii_143">[143]</a></span>
from whence: but after they had sailed at the sea certaine
dayes, they came vnto that place that according as it was
given them to vnderstande, is the cittie of Canton, of the
which they have heard declared many straunge thinges.
The Chino asked how the guardes of the sea, and shippes
that were in the straight aforesaid, did let them passe? they
answered that they saw no guards nor any other that did
trouble them their passage. This last answere did cause the
christian Chino greatly to admire, who being moued with a
good zeale, said vnto them, that they should returne againe
vnto the shippe, and not to come forth untill such time as he
had giuen aduice of their comming vnto the mandelines of
the sea, which be certaine iudges appointed to giue aduice
of all such matters to the governor, that he may command
what is to be done therein.</p>

<p>So the Spaniards returned vnto the shippe, wheras they
remained a good while, and passed great heate, for that it
dooth exceede in that port. So after a while, they sawe
come vnto a house which was neere vnto the gate of the
cittie, a man of great authoritie, who was brought in a litter
chaire, and much people came with him; he stayed at that
house, and from thence sent to call vnto him the religious
men and all the rest that came in their company; before
them all came one that carried a table, all whited, and
thereon was written certain great letters, with blacke ynke,
the which (as after they understood) was the licence that the
gouernor of the cittie gaue them for to come a shoore, without
the which there is no stranger permitted. The fathers did
straightwayes obey it, and came forth of their shippe with
more companie than they desired, of such as came to see
them, who were so many in number, that although the sergeants
and officers of the iudge that sent for them, did beate
them for to make way, yet was it a good while before they
coulde come vnto the house wheras the iudge was, although
the way was but short. So when they approched nigh, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_144" id="Page_ii_144">[144]</a></span>
of the sergeants bad them kneele down before the iudge, the
which they did with great humilitie without any replication.
Hee was set in a verie rich chaire with so great maiestie that
they were greatly astonyed to see it, and the more when that
they understood by the christian Chino that he was not the
gouernor, neither of the supreme iudges; hee was apparelled
in a robe of silke, close from aboue down to the foot, with
the sleeues very wide, and a girdle imbossed, and on his
head a bonnet full of brooches, such as bishops doo use on
their mytres. Before him was set a table, whereon was paper
and inke, and on the one side and on the other, two rankes
of men, as though they were to guard him, yet without
weapons. They had al of them in their hands, long canes of
foure fingers brode, with the which (as after they did vnderstand),
they do beat such as are offenders, vpon the calues
of their legges, with great crueltie, as hath been told you in
the first books of this historie. All these had vppon their
heads a manner of helmet, made of blacke leather, and on
them great plumes of pecocks' feathers, with brooches made
of mettal, a thing vsed to be worne in that countrie of such
as are executioners or ministers of iustice.</p>

<p>The iudge had the interpreter to aske them of what nation
they were, and what they sought in that countrie, and who
was their guide to bring them into that port: the which
being vnderstood by the religious men, answered that they
were Spaniards, and subject vnto the king Philip of Spaine,
and came thether to preach the holy gospel, and to teach
them to know the true God, creator of the heauen and
<span class="sidenote">Marke the Friers confession of images.</span>
earth, and to leaue off the worshiping of their idols (who
haue no more power of themselues, then that which is giuen
them by him that doth make them): the which worship is
knowne and receiued by his holie law, and declared by the
mouth of his only begotton Sonne, and confirmed with
diuine tokens from heaven, in whose guarde doth consist the
saluation of all soules. And to the last, touching who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_145" id="Page_ii_145">[145]</a></span>
their guide vnto that kingdome: they answered, That it was
God, vnto whose will all creature are subiect, as vnto the
true creator: all the which (as afterward it did appeare) the
interpreter did not truely interpret of the interpretation of
the Spaniards: vnderstanding, that if hee should truely interpret
what they saide, the iudge would forthwith sende
them away, which would be the occasion that he shuld get
nothing of them. So that he made his interpretation as at
best seemed for his purpose, fearing (as after he did confesse)
that if he shuld declare the truth of that which the
Spaniards had said, it would haue beene verie odious to the
iudge, and afterward both vnto them and to himselfe might
be the occasion of some great euill: but to conclude, he
answered and told the iudge that they were certaine religious
men, who liued in common a sharpe and asper life,
much after the manner of those of that kingdome: and that
going from the Iland of Luzon vnto the Ilands of the Illocos,
in a great storme and tempest that chanced them, the ship
wherin they were was cast away, and al their people cast
away, sauing they, who escaped by vsing great diligence,
and put themselues in that small ship, which came in company
with another greater shippe, without pilot or mariner,
for that they were almost all drowned; and setting saile in
the best manner they could or knewe, being holpen and
constrained by necessity, they let their ship saile, and go
whither as fortune did cary them. So after many dangers
and stormes at the sea, according to the will of the heauens
they came vnto this port, whose name as yet they knew not.
The iudge asked them where they had that Chino that
they brought in their company for an interpreter. They
answered that he was in Luzon, and captiue vnto a Spaniard:
they tooke him and set him free, and hee vnderstanding
that they were bound vnto the firme land of China,
which was his naturall countrie, he requested them to carrie
him thither; the which they did with a very good will, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_146" id="Page_ii_146">[146]</a></span>
that they had neede of him to vtter their desire, if neede did
so require. All the which the other interpreter fearing,
that if he should tel vnto the iudge how that he was captiue
vnto the Christians, hee would bee offended, and therefore
hee did falsifie the same and saide, that comming vnto an
iland to take in fresh water, they found the boy there, where
he was captiue eight yeares before, and came thither forced
with a great storme, in the which was drowned a merchants
shippe that was bound to Luzon, and he alone escaped by
swimming; and so hee came aborde the shippe in the which
were the fathers, not knowing whither they went. All these
vntruthes he did inuent for to dissemble and go forwards
with his knavish pretence, and would not declare the true
intent of the friers: the which he had decreed with himselfe
how to doo before the iudge did sende to call them.
Moreouer, the iudge did aske them what they brought in
their small shippe; they answered that they brought nothing
but one chest and two little fardels of bookes, and an ornament
for to say masse. This did the interpreter declare
truely vnto the iudge, for that experience might be made
thereof. So the iudge forthwith commanded that it should
be brought before him, the which being done, he caused it
to be vndone, and he perused euery thing by it selfe, the
which being strange vnto him, for that he neuer saw the
like, he made signes vnto them that he receiued great contentment
in the seeing of them, but specially of the images
they brought: but that which did best please him was an ara
or sopra-altar, of a blacke stone, the which did shine so bright
that they might see themselues therein, as well as in a glasse.
These friers did bring the same with them out of the kingdom
of Mexico, whereas you haue great aboundance, but specially
in the prouince of Mechuacan. So after that hee had seene
all, and sawe that it was drie, without any signe or token
that it had beene in the sea, hee called to remembrance the
wordes of the interpreter in the name of the fathers, touching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_147" id="Page_ii_147">[147]</a></span>
the storme wherein their shippe was cast away, and howe
that they escaped by swimming, and put themselues in that
small shippe in the which they came: and considering of the
same, it seemed vnto him that they did fable in that which
they had saide: so that he did replie and asked if it were
true that which they had before declared, and howe it shoulde
bee that their bookes and other things were not wet at the
sea, which was an euident token and plainely to be vnderstood
that they had fabled and told lies, and so he belieued
they did in all the rest. The interpreter, fearing least by
that argument his falshod would be discouered, he fel in
talke a while with the friers, asking and answering things
very different to that which the iudge had commanded him.
Then he with a strange and sharpe boldnes answered to the
difficulty proponed by the iudge, and said, That as all merchants
at such time as their shippes are readie to sinke and
to be lost, they doo procure first to saue such thinges as are
of most estimation, forgetting all the rest: euen so these
religious men did procure with great care and diligence to
saue those books and that ornament, which is all their treasure,
and yet for all their diligences done they lost a great
number mo. All these fables and lies, after many dayes, the
religious fathers came to haue the knowledge of.</p>

<p>The iudge did aske them if they brought any armor or
weapons in their shippe? they answered that they were no
men to bring them, neither according vnto their profession,
they could not wear nor use them, for that they were religious,
and professed other matters contrary vnto the vse of
armor or weapon, promising and auowing unto God perpetual
povertie and chastitie, and vnto their superior prelates obedience
all the dayes of their liues. The iudge returned and
asked them if they had any monie, and where withall they
did eate and apparell themselues, and bought those bookes
and ornaments? they answered, that all that which they had
was giuen them by secular christians for God's sake whome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_148" id="Page_ii_148">[148]</a></span>
they did serue, for that they should pray for them, and
for the saluation of their soules.</p>

<p>The iudge, when he heard this, was greatly astonied,
for that the interpreter did declare the truth, and made
signes that he recieued griefe and had pittie on them, although
he gaue not full credite to that which he heard, but said that
he would go aborde their shippe, to see if they did say
the truth, in not bringing anie armor or weapon, neither
silver nor merchandize. This did hee straightwayes put in
ure, and commaunded them that brought him in the litter
chaire vpon their shoulders to go thitherward. All those
people did beare him companie, as also a great number that
were there ioyned togither to heare the examination of those
strangers, and also the Spaniards he commanded to go next
vnto him.</p>

<p>So that when he was in their shippe, set in his chaire, his
ministers began to search the shippe in all places, both aboue
and below, and could finde nothing but a little rice, which
was left of that which they brought with them: they gaue
the iudge to vnderstand thereof, who looking vpon the
Spaniards, said that all they that were in the shippe might
heare him. These do speak the truth, and they doo seeme vnto
me to bee good people, and without any superstition, and
without all doubte they doo come and will be after the manner
of our religious men, according as is to be seene in the
vniformitie of their apparell, as also in their heads and beardes.
Then he beganne to demaunde of them certaine thinges, more
of curiositie then of suspection; who answered him, casting
up their eies vnto heauen, (for that their talke was thereof),
and they saw that the iudge did greatly reioyce and had
pleasure therein, for that it seemed that they had the heauens
for their God, as they haue, by reason they did so much looke
upwards. After this the iudge came foorth of the shippe,
but the religious men remained behind at his commandment
with his companions; and likewise hee commaunded certaine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_149" id="Page_ii_149">[149]</a></span>
of those officers that came with him, to remaine about their
ship at the water's side, for their guard, more for that none
should doo to them any harme, then for any euil suspition
they had of them.</p>

<p>Al that day that the Spaniards were in their ship the
countrie men came downe to the water side to see them, and
that in so great number that they did woonder to see them;
and on the other side they were greatly reioyced to see so
many soules there ioyned togither, hoping that when it
should bee the will and pleasure of God to giue them oportunitie,
to baptise them all.</p>

<p>The next day following, in the morning, they sawe another
mandelin or judge, comming towards their shippe, accompanied
with much people, and with little less maiestie than
the other had, who entered into their shippe and commaunded
to search both aboue and belowe, to see whether they brought
any armour, weapon, or any other kinde of merchandize;
and seeing that they could finde nothing else but their bookes
and their ornament aforesaide, he commaunded it to be
brought before him, who did peruse the same peece by peece
with great admiration, and shewed great contentment that
hee received to see their bookes and images, although that
which did most content him was to see the ara of blacke stone,
as was said before. Then hee commanded one of the fathers
for to reade in one of the said bookes, and for to write, the
which was done before him with so great facilitie, that the
judge receiued great contentment to see it. Then hee
asked them if that with the said letters they could write any
other language that were different vnto theirs. The fathers
answered yea, that they coulde write any language; and for
a plainer proofe they wrote on a piece of paper, certaine
reasons in the iudges language, the which did cause him
greatly to maruell, and said (turning his face to some of them
that came with him), these men are not barbarous, nor of
any euill condition, so farre as I can see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_150" id="Page_ii_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>With this he departed out of their shippe, and went to giue
the gouernour (who sent him), to vnderstand of that he had
seene and coulde vnderstande of the Spaniards in this his
visitation, who straightwayes did sende them a licence vpon
a table, that they shoulde come on shore, and be suffered to
enter into the cittie freely at their will.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniards go forth of their ship, and go into the citie unto the christened
Chinos house, and are carried before another superior judge in
common audience, and manie other passe with them.</i></p></div>


<p>So soone as they had their licence, they went forth of their
ship and entred in at the gate of the cittie, although with
great trouble by reason of the great number of people that
came to see them, as a thing neuer seen before. Then they
went to the christened Chinos house (hee that serued for
their interpreter), who made very much of them, and giuing
them to vnderstand that hee had made a true report of all
that they had commanded him, and did offer himselfe to do
so much with the justices, that he would procure to get licence
of the gouernor for them to remain in the countrie, and to
giue them a house wherein to remaine and dwel; and did
admonish them that at that time they should not deale for to
make the Chinos christians, vntil such time as they were
better knowne, and coulde speake the language, and then
should they doo it with a great deale more ease. All these
promises, with the falsifying of that the Spaniards spake
before to the iudges, was to content the friers (as in discourse
of time they did vnderstande), and onely to get monie from
them, for that it seemed vnto him that it could not be but that
they shoulde have good stoore, for that they came from a rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_151" id="Page_ii_151">[151]</a></span>
countrie whereas it was; and againe to come about businesse
of so great importance, about the which they shoulde remaine
there a long time (as aforesaide), as they afterwarde did more
at large vnderstande. If that interpreter had declared in
fidelitie all that which they had spoken, without al doubt they
woulde not have suffered them to have come on shoare, else
have put them in some prison for that they came on land without
licence; and to have shewed them the most fauour they
woulde haue caused them to returne from whence they came;
whereas the guardes of the straight (of whom we have spoken
of before), woulde either in secrete or publike sinke them at
the sea, for that they were all greatly in hatred against them;
the reason was that the Aytao, who is (as is declared in the
first booke of this historie), the president of the counsell of
warre, had vnderstanding howe that they passed thorough
the fleete and were not seene, which was a thing that they
all wondred at.</p>

<p>This Aytao did forthwith make secret information of the
same, and found it to be true, whereuppon hee did iudge the
captaines to perpetuall prison where they were well whipped,
and did secrest<a name="FNanchor_1_39" id="FNanchor_1_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> all their goods; for the which all their kinsfolkes
and the rest of the guards had great indignation against
the Spaniards, and would with great ease have beene reuenged
on them, but that they did feare the punishment that should
bee doone on them after that it should be knowne. In the
which they doo execute their iustice in this kingdom more
then in any place in all the world.</p>

<p>In the house of this christened Chino they dined that day,
as they did many more afterwarde, but every night they
returned to their fregat to bed, for that they durst not leave
their things alone, neither to lie out of their shippe, for that
one of the iudges had so commanded.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniards are called before a iudge, who doth examine them, and offer

<p>Vpon Saint John baptist day they were called before a
iudge, who (as after this did vnderstand), was a superiour
vnto the other past; but when they came whereas he was in
place of audience, his ministers did straight wayes commande
them to kneele downe at such time as they came in sight of
the iudge, which was vnto the religious men no small torment.
He demanded of them the same that the others did,
and they answered in briefe, that they came to preach the
holy gospell, and requested him to giue them licence to
execute the same, and to remain in that cittie of Canton for
to learne the China tongue, whereby they might giue them
to vnderstande and knowe the trueth of the heauen. The
interpreter did falsifie their wordes as hee had doone vnto
the other iudges, and said no more but for so much that
fortune and foul weather had driuen them into that port, they
would liue amongst them, although it were to serue them as
slaves; for that if they woulde returne vnto the ilande of
Luzon, or by another name called Manilla, they could not
for that they knewe not the way, neither had they anie pilot
to conduct them.</p>

<p>The iudge had pittie on them, and commanded that such
thinges as they had in their shippe should be brought on
land, for that he woulde see them; amongst the which, the
thing which caused him most to maruell at was when hee
sawe the images, and ara (or alter stone), of blacke jasper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_153" id="Page_ii_153">[153]</a></span>
stone (of the which we have made large mention.) Hee
requested of the Spaniards that they woulde giue them two
images, which when they had given them they made shew
to esteeme greatly of the present, for that they were things
that they have not amongst them. He talked with them very
friendly, and caused them to arise from the ground whereas
they did kneele, and to shewe them the more fauour he
caused to be giuen them to drinke, in his presence, a certaine
beurage which they do vse made of certaine hearbs, and vse
it for a comfortable thing for the heart, and is commonly vsed
amongst them although they are not dry, and amongst the
Chinos is a shew of particular fauour.</p>

<p>This iudge did more vnderstande the intent of the Spaniards
than any of the other past, for their interpreter had tolde
unto him that they woulde remaine in the countrie for to
cure sicke persons and to bury the dead, the which they
could do excellent well. When the iudge heard these wordes
hee gaue with his hande a great stroke vppon the table
that was before him, and said with showes of great wonder
unto other inferior judges that were with him: Oh! what
good people are these as it seemeth; it would be vnto mee a
great ioy, if that I coulde of mine owne authoritie accomplish
that which they do desire, but our lawes do forbid the
same and that with great rigour. All this did their interpreter
tel them afterward. At this time there entred into
the place of audience whereas they were, a man of China, one
of the common sort, al imbrewed with blood, crying out and
making a great noise without any consort, who prostrating
<span class="sidenote">The Chinos most vpright in all their
iudgements and in execution of iustice.</span>
himselfe upon the ground did complaine of other Chinos with
whom he had fallen out, and was beaten and buffeted in
cruell sort. The iudge when he saw him, did straight wayes
command his officers to bring the offenders before him, the
which was done with a trice, and they returned with the
plaintife, bringing three other Chinos bound together by the
armes, and as it seemed they were men of base sort. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_154" id="Page_ii_154">[154]</a></span>
judge incontinent made information wholly of all that passed,
and condemned them without writing any letter, in twenty
sotes<a name="FNanchor_1_40" id="FNanchor_1_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> or strokes a peece. The officers forthwith took them
with so great cruelty as though they had bin diuels, and
threwe them vpon the ground with their bellies downwards
to execute the sentence giuen by the iudge; and when they
had pulled off their hose, they began to whippe them vpon
the calues of their legges with a sot made of canes, in manner
as hath beene told you before. The religious people
who were present all this while, and taking pity on these
condemned men fell downe at the feet of the iudge, and by
signes and tokens did craue of him for the love of God, that
his sentence might not be executed, who straightwayes commanded
the executioners to cease, condiscending vnto the
petition of the friers, and did pardon the offenders fifteene
sottes or strokes of the twentie, wherein they were condemned.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_40" id="Footnote_1_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> The translator seems to have made this word himself from the
Spanish, "azote", a scourge.</p></div>

<p>The iudge did very much woonder at the pouertie of these
religious men, and at the sharpe and asper apparell that they
weare: but the chiefest thing that they did maruell at, was
when that he vnderstoode howe they had passed the fleete of
ships that were put in the straight for to defende and keepe
the coast, and were neuer seene, which seemed vnto
him a thing impossible, except it were by permission of the
heauen.</p>

<p>So when this examination and talke was finished, he commanded
them to returne unto their shippe, promising them
for to write vnto the vizroy (who was thirtie leagues from
that place), and to giue him to vnderstand that they were
men without any suspection, and that he might wel giue
them licence for to come to his presence: vpon which relation
hee woulde commaunde what shoulde bee doone, either
to tarrie or to go vnto him.</p>

<p>Within few dayes after they vnderstood that the iudge had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_155" id="Page_ii_155">[155]</a></span>
accomplished his promise, for that the vizroy had committed
the matter vnto another iudge called Aytao, whose office is
for to examine and inquire the causes of strangers: the
wordes of the commission were as followeth.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The vizroies commission.</span>
"I am written vnto from Canton, howe that there are come
thither certaine men apparelled very sharpe and asper, after
the fashion of our religious men in the wildernesse, who
bringe no weapons, neither any other thing that might seeme
to pretend any euill intent: and for that they are thy charge,
examine them with care and diligence, and prouide to doo
therein that which shall be most requisite and conuenient:
giuing vs to vnderstand the large and true relation of that
which shall happen."</p>

<p>The verie same day of Saint Iohn, the Spaniards being
verie merry and vnmindfull of any thing, for that they had
all that day receiued the Sacrament: there came vnto them
abord their shippe or frigat the interpreters, and did euidently
declare their euill purpose and intent, (saying) that it
was apparent what they had done for them, and in what
perill they did euery day put themselues in for their matters,
and that it was reason that they shoulde pay them for the
same, and if not, they would not helpe them any more,
neither interpret or take paines in their businesse: certifying
them that if they did faile to satisfie them, that they should
not finde any that would doo it with so great good will and
diligence (as they should finde by experience); and how that
they had beene put in prison if they had not beene, for entring
into that kingdome without licence; and for that they
enterpreted for them with great curtesie and fauour, they
had also been commaunded to returne back againe from
whence they came, which by their meanes was the cause
that the iudges did entreat them so friendly as they did.
The father Costodio when he vnderstoode their intente, and
did evidently see that it was wholly grounded vppon gaine;
considering also the vrgent necessitie that they had of them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_156" id="Page_ii_156">[156]</a></span>
and not satisfying them, it was difficult to find any for to
help them in that their necessitie, of two euils he chose the
best, and deliuered vnto them a pawne for their contentemente,
one of the two challices they brought with them, giuing
<span class="sidenote">A sacred thing no doubt of it.</span>
them great charge to vse and keep it as a sacred thing and
dedicated for to consecrate the blood of Christ. The principall
interpreter did take it with great content, and presently
gaue it a newe master, in selling it vnto a gold smith for as
much as it was woorth, who did melt it, and made things
thereof according to his trade: yet they not being content
therewith, and that it seemed vnto them that those fathers
could not but bring with them much riches, they inquired of
the China boy whom they brought to bee their interpreter,
with faire words to know if they had any golde or siluer, or
pretious stones, or any other thing of valure; but when they
vnderstoode that they brought none of those things but onely
their bookes and some other ornaments to say masse, they
straightwayes imagined in their mindes, and that with great
care and diligence, to procure some way to get from them
the other challice which they had seen; and the better to put
it in execution, they repeated againe vnto the friers that
which before hath been told you, augmenting thereunto
many wordes and reasons, affirming that they had spent vpon
them in giuing them to eate twelue taes<a name="FNanchor_1_41" id="FNanchor_1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> more then the challice
which they had giuen them did weigh or amount to, which
was twelue ducats of Spaine; hauing before giuen them to
vnderstand at such time as they did eate they did it of almes
and for God's sake, and with so great content, that many
times it happened when they saw the Spaniards would not
eate any dainty thing, but woulde feed and content themselues
with base victuals, he would say vnto them they shoulde eate
without any grief or care, that when it should so fall out that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_157" id="Page_ii_157">[157]</a></span>
his subtance did fail him, hee woulde then pawne one of his
sonnes to buy victuals.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_41" id="Footnote_1_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Tael, Tale, or Taes, is the Portuguese word for Leang, the Chinese
word for ounce, usually ounce of silver, and about one-third more than
an ounce avoirdupois.</p></div>

<p>The father Costodio plainly seeing and vnderstanding that
their intent and purpose was wholly grounded for to get
from him the other challice, he answered that he had not for
to giue them, and how that he had giuen the other challice
in pawn of that which they had spent in victuals, and for
their trauell that they had taken for them. The interpreter
did replie, saying, that if they had nothing, that they shoulde
seeke it, seeing that they ought it for their victuals which
they had eaten; and it was the vse of that countrie, that
when any man did owe any thing, and hath not for to pay
the same, for to sell their children, or else to become slaues
vnto their creditor; they demanded the other challice that
remained, for that the other which they had giuen them did
weigh but sixteene taes, which was but a small matter in
respect of their desert, onely for their trauel in their enterpretations.
This frier Costodio did pacifie them in the
best maner hee coulde, promising to pay both the one and
the other, hauing oportunitie for the same, and that they
woulde procure it with as great care as was possible, and
requesting him for to keepe the challice, that he had given
him in pawne, in great veneration, for that hee did esteeme
it much more for the consecration and dedication vnto the
deuine Colto,<a name="FNanchor_1_42" id="FNanchor_1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> then for the value of that it wayed, and more,
promised him upon his worde to write vnto the Portugals
that were in Machao, signifying unto them their necessitie
and to demande their almes and charity, and looke whatsoever
they did send them, being little or much, should be
giuen him. Then the interpreter, who had his eyes fixed
vppon gaine, saide, that they shoulde forthwith write, and
that hee woulde giue him a messenger for to carrie the
letter, and to bring answere of the same, as he had doone
the like not many dayes before. The father Costodio did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_158" id="Page_ii_158">[158]</a></span>
write vnto the bishoppe that was in Machao, giuing him to
vnderstande of his comming and of his companions vnto the
cittie of Canton, and howe that his comming thither was onelie
to procure for to preach the holy gospel, and for to conuert
and turne to God those blinde idolaters. The which letter
being receiued by the bishop, he made answere, praysing
their intent and purpose, animating them with godly wordes
of exhortation, and therewith did sende and demand the
copie of such authoritie as they brought from the holy father
touching that the which they pretended. This hee did for
that all the sayde countrie vnto the lande of Iapon was committed
vnto him by the holy father.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_42" id="Footnote_1_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> Worship.</p></div>

<p>Unto this letter, the father Costodio answered, that hauing
oportunitie, he woulde obey his commandement, and shew
vnto him the facultie he brought, and also woulde him selfe
in person go thether for to kisse his handes, and to satisfie all
the inhabitants of that towne, for that it was giuen him to
understande that they reported euill of them, and sayde that
they were vacabondes and lost men, and not true religious
men, neither sacerdotes nor priests; and how that they had
requested certaine Chinos, which at that time came vnto
Machao, that at their returne againe vnto Canton they should
tell the iudges and aduertise them with good aduisement,
how that there were certaine Castillos come into their cittie,
whom they did certainely know not to be of their nation, but
of an other, and subiects vnto a different and strange king,
whom they did beleeue to come thether for some ill intent
and purpose in counterfeit attire, and came for spyes from the
Castillos of Luzon, and that they did beleeue that after them
did come some armie to do hurt in some part of that countrie,
and that they should prevent it in time, for that if so be that
any thing should happen, the fault should not be imputed
vnto them.</p>

<p>All this the Portingales did (as afterwards they did plainely
vnderstande) for feare that the Castillos should take from them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_159" id="Page_ii_159">[159]</a></span>
their contractation and gaine which they had in that city;
by which occasion their intente did so proceede forward, that
they did certifie the Chinos, that the chiefe captaine of
Machao, who was put there by the king of Portingale, had
presented a petition vnto a citie that was ioyning to Canton,
aduertising the iudges of that before spoken of, and protesting
that if any harme or damage should come to that country
in admitting the Castillos, that it should not be imputed vnto
them.</p>

<p>But the iudge vnderstanding their euill intent, and that
their accusations were more vppon malice and enuie then of
any trueth, he answered vnto the same, that he was particularly
informed of those religious persons, against whom they
did complaine, how that they were men of whom they needed
not to feare, and without any suspition; as it did plainely
appeare when they did visite their ship, wherein they came,
where they found nothing, but onely a fewe bookes and some
other thinges which did more signifie deuotion than to make
any warre. This iudge (notwithstanding the answere he
made), for that afterwards the chiefe captaine should not
raise vp some inuention, tooke the originall petition, and sent
it with great securitie vnto the viceroy of the prouince of
Aucheo, that he might see and peruse it; who when that he
had easily perceiued it, and vnderstood the intent of him that
presented the same, and the innocencie of them that were
therein complained of, he sent and commanded the gouernor
of Canton for to giue them good intertainment, and not to
permit any harme or hurt to be done vnto them, and that he
should send them vnto the city of Aucheo, for that he would
see them, for that it was tolde him that they seemed to be
holy men, and although that they had their apparell in the
same forme, of the Austin friers, (whome he had seene), yet
their garments were of an other colour and more asper.</p>

<p>The chief captaine seeing that his intent fell not out well
with the iudges of China, he commanded to be proclaymed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_160" id="Page_ii_160">[160]</a></span>
publicke in Machao that none should write vnto them, nor
communicate with them vpon paine of banishment, and to
pay two thousande ducats. All this was not sufficient for to
coole the mindes of some deuout persons of the religion of
the glorious Saint Francis, but were rather incyted to offer
their fauour and helpe seeing they had neede thereof; but
in particular the bishop did helpe tham alwaies with his
almes, and also an honorable priest called Andres Cotino,
who making small account of the proclamation did write vnto
them diverse times, although secretly, and sent their letters
with almes and many exhortations to proceed forward with
their holy zeale and intent. Besides this they sent vnto them
a Spaniard called Pedro Quintero, who had dwelt there
many years amongest the Portingals, and hauing oportunitie
they sent him many times with comfortable things and
letters, but not signed, for if happily they should be met with
all, they might denie them to be theirs.</p>

<p>Now returning to our purpose, the interpreter, with
desire to be payed of that which hee saide he had spent and
laide out, did bring the messenger that he promised them to
go vnto Machao to carrie their letters vnto such religious
men as they knewe; in the which he craued their almes and
helpe for to pay their interpreter, and praying them for the
love of God to sende them likewise so much as should
redeeme their challice (who at this time knew not how it
was solde and broken).</p>

<p>This messenger went with all diligence and secrecie, and
returned with the like, and brought with him that which
they sent for and other iunkets of great content, the which
came in very good season, for that one of the sayde friers,
called frier Sebastian, of S. Francis, was very sick of a strong
ague, whereof in few daies after he died, very wel and with
a strange desire to suffer martyrdome for God's sake. When
this messenger came, there was come thither the Aytao who
is iudge of the strangers, and was without the citie, vnto whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_161" id="Page_ii_161">[161]</a></span>
was committed the examination of the Spaniards, who after
that he had concluded other matters, commanded them to be
brought afore him with great love and gentlenesse, for so the
viceroy of Aucheo had commanded him.</p>

and deceit: they be carried before the iudges of the citie, with whom
they do intreat of diuers matters: they do aduise the viceroy of al,

<p>Because they would not see themselues in the like danger
with the interpreter, as that which was past, they would not
go any more to eate at his house, but rather to giue an
example vnto those of the citie, they went foorth every day
by two and two to aske almes; and although they were infidels,
yet they gaue them with great contentment and ioie,
because it was a rare thing in that kingdome to see them
begge in the streetes, by reason, as hath been tolde you, that
they haue no poore folk, neither are they permitted, if there
be any, to aske in the streetes nor in their temples. When
that the gouernor vnderstoode thereof, and how that they
did it for pure necessitie, and had no other waies to maintaine
themselues, hee commanded to be giuen them euerie
day, a certaine stipend vpon the kinges cost, the which was
with so great abundance, that mainteining the souldiers that
came with them, and all the rest, yet had they to spare, for
that their stipende was giuen them in money, which was sixe

mayesses<a name="FNanchor_1_43" id="FNanchor_1_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> of siluer, whereof they had to spare, for that all
thinges in that countrie is so good cheape, as hath been
told you in many places.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_43" id="Footnote_1_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> Mace or mayes is the Portuguese word for Tsien, the tenth of an

by the Portuguese.</p></div>

<p>Their interpreter, seeing the good newes that was brought
from Machao for the Spaniardes, by a bill that a certayne
deuout man had sent him in secret, whereupon would be
giuen vnto him all that was needeful, with protestation to
pay all that should be giuen vnto them although it should
amount vnto a great summe (with the which hee wrote a
letter vnto the Fryer Costodio of great comfort, in strengthening
him and all the rest to perseuer in their intent which
God had put in their mindes for the saluation of those soules),
the Interpreter (I say) beganne to imagine, that for to profite
himselfe it was conuenient for to delate and detract the
departure of the Spaniardes, and did exact vpon them euery
day, in the buying of their uictuals, the halfe of the money
that was giuen them.</p>

<p>So vpon a day he came verie much out of order, and
fayned that the aytao had commanded that they should
forthwith depart out of the kingdome; but yet notwithstanding
he would present a petition in their name, saying,
that for as much as time did not serue them to nauigate,
neither was their shippe in plight for to make their iourney,
that it would please them to get them a house whereas they
might remaine three or four monethes, in the which time
they might prouide them of all thinges necessarie for their
voyage; and possible it may so fall out that in this time,
they seeing their manner of liuing to bee good, and to shew
good examples, they may let them to remaine in the countrie
liberally and to learne the language, and then beginne to
preach and declare the right way vnto heauen. All this he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_163" id="Page_ii_163">[163]</a></span>
spake with great dissimulation for to profite himselfe, for he
knewe verie well that the aytao had willed him to tell them,
that they could not remaine in that countrie with the pretence
they had; for that there was a lawe ordained to the
contrarie, without expresse licence from the king, the which
will last of all be granted vnto the Spaniardes or Portingals,
<span class="sidenote">A prophesie.</span>
for that there is a prophesie amongest them, spoken by the
mouth of the diuell, and esteemed amongest them for a very
truth, for that other thinges which he spake when that was
spoken hath beene verified, in the which he doth pronounce
that a time shall come, that they shall be subiect vnto a
nation whose men shall haue great beardes and long noses,
and sharpe broade eyes (as we would say cats eyes), in the
which they do differ from them. For it is a great maruaile
to finde a man amongst them with more then twentie heares
in his beard, little more or lesse, flat noses, and their eyes
very little, so that when they will mocke a man, or doo him
any iniurie by word, they will call him "cats eyes".</p>

<p>Now for that the desire of the Spaniardes was nothing else
but to remaine in that countrie, for to bring to effect their
good zeale, they did gratifie the interpreter for the great
fauour hee shewed them, and did earnestly entreat him for
to present the petition, thinking thereby their desire should
be vnderstood, and Gods cause iustified, so that they first
would enter into them by the way of preaching. He presented
the petition when that all the iudges were together,
who had great pitie and compassion ouer the Spaniardes,
and willed that they should come before them, for that they
would see and vnderstande the roote and foundation of their
will. They obeyed their commandement with great ioy, and
when they were come into the hall, one of the iudges, who
was superior ouer all the rest, and a man of great authoritie,
did aske of them by way of the interpreter, what was their
pretence in that they did aske a house to dwell in, the Frier
Costodio did answere, that he did desire it for to learne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_164" id="Page_ii_164">[164]</a></span>
the language well, by which meanes they might the better
learne them to know the true God, and to set them in the
true way to goe and glorie with him, because it was his office
and his profession.</p>

<p>The interpreter tolde all this truely, the which fewe times
before he had done, as hath beene tolde you. Then the
iudge, in name of all the rest, sayde, that in that their demand
they could not grant, neyther had they any such
authoritie to giue licence.</p>

<p>This being spoken, the interpreter replyed, without tarrying
to heare what the Spaniardes would say, and said, that
at least wayes they would giue them licence to remaine there
till such time as the Portingals did come thether for to lade
their marchandice, which would be within few daies, with
whom they would go, for that they were all of one law and
faith. The iudge did againe aske them if that the Portingals
and Spaniards were al one. The father Costodio answered,
that in religion and lawes there was no difference, but the
one were subiects to one king and the other to another, although
they were kinsmen and that very nigh. This last
petition seemed to the iudge to be more reasonable and iust
than the first, and that they might grant it them with lesse
difficultie, although he answered them and said, that he
could not grant it vnto them, but he would write vnto the
viceroy for to grant it them. For that the Portugals would
bee there at the farthest within foure or fiue monethes, and
that in the meane time he would giue them a prouision
that they may go freely abroad, and none to hurt nor harme
them.</p>

<p>So the next day following, which was the second of
August, he did accomplish his word and promise, and sent
vnto the viceroy their petition, and therewithall his iudgment
and of all the rest that were there with him, what they
thought touching that matter. The answere staid many daies
after and came not, but in the ende there came a commandement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_165" id="Page_ii_165">[165]</a></span>
from the viceroy vnto the gouernor of Canton, in the
which hee willed that the Spaniards should be sent vnto
Aucheo whereas he was, and that there should be carried
with them all such thinges as they brought with them, which
was their bookes and ornaments.</p>

<p>The iudge did straightwaies send and gaue them to vnderstande
of this new order, because they should make themselues
readie for to trauaile: the which they did with great
ioy and diligence, as you shall vnderstand in the chapter
following.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAP_II_VII" id="CHAP_II_VII"></a>CHAP. VII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniardes take their iourney towardes Aucheo, and declare what
happened in the way thitherwarde.</i></p></div>


<p>The next day following, which was the sixteenth day of
August, the Spaniards departed from Canton towards Aucheo
to see the viceroy, with great hope and confidence that he
would giue them licence for that which they pretended.
But at their departure, they would have left there two Indians
for to keepe their ship or frigat; but the iudges that were
present said, that it was not needefull for them to haue any
such care, for that they would take the care vppon them to
see all thinges in good order. So presently they sent certaine
writing in papers, and commaunded them to bee glewed
vppon the hatches of their shippe, in such sort that they
could not bee open but they must be perceiued. Then presently
was brought for the Spaniardes foure barkes, verie
gallant and wide, with verie fayre galleries and windowes;
and beeing imbarked, they charged them verie much to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_166" id="Page_ii_166">[166]</a></span>
make all haste possible to accomplish the commandement of
the viceroy; and sent with them conuenient persons for to
be their guides, and to giue them all thinges necessarie for
their iourney. They traueiled continually in a mightie riuer
against the current, in the which they did see many thinges
woorthie to be noted for the space of foure daies that their
iourney indured.</p>

<p>There was alongest the riuer side manie cities and townes
verie great, which were so many in number that they could
not make any memorie of them, by reason that they passed
manie of them by night, to obserue the tides, and to auoid
the heate, which was great vppon the water. Alongest the
riuer side (whereas it was not inhabited) was full of corne
fieldes, whereas they sawe them go to plough with many
bufalos, much different vnto the vse of Spaine; for that one
alonely buffe did drawe the plough, with one vpon his backe,
who did gouerne and guide him with great ease whether hee
would they should go, with a corde made fast to a ring at his
nose, which serued in steede of a bridle.</p>

<p>They sawe also flockes of geese, in the which were more
then twentie thousand; with whom they did weede, and
tooke away the grasse which did growe amongst the rice and
other graine and seedes, driuing them in the middest of their
fieldes; and it seemed that they had the vse of reason, considering
how they did separate and make a distinction betwixt
the good seede and the bad, and the great care they
had to feede and do no harme, neither to plucke vp the good
plant, which was a thing that they wondred at aboue all the
rest. All the countrie is verie populous, and the townes one
so neere an other, that it may better be sayde to be all one
towne and not manie, and might with more propertie be
called the citie of China, and not the kingdome of China.
In all the whole countrie there is not one foot of ground
vnoccupied, by reason of the great abundance of people that
there is; and they permit amongest them no idle people (as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_167" id="Page_ii_167">[167]</a></span>
more at large it hath beene declared vnto you); and the
countrie beeing fertile, is the occasion that they have all
thinges in great abundance and at a lowe price.</p>

<p>Now to returne to their voyage, the which they made
verie well and with great recreation, as well in the townes
alongst the riuer side, as vpon the riuer, whereas they were
cherished with great care: in the end of foure dayes, which
was the twentieth day of August, they entred into the
suburbes of the citie of Aucheo, but so late that they were
constrayned to remaine there till the next day: whereas they
found all thinges necessarie and in good order, aswell for
their bedding as for their supper, to passe away the night.
The next day, very early in the morning, he that was their
conduct and guide, made great haste for to goe and see what
the viceroy would command.</p>

<p>They trauailed through a great and long streete, which
seemed vnto them to be more than a league, and thought
that they had gone through the citie. So when they had
passed that street they came vnto the gate of the citie, and
there they vnderstoode that the rest which they had gone
and passed was the suburbes. The mightinesse of this citie,
and the great admiration they had, with the multitude of
people, and a wonderfull great bridge the which they passed,
with many other thinges of the which they made mention,
we do let passe, for that it is declared vnto you more at large
in the relation giuen by the Augustin friers, in the booke
before this, at their entrie into the sayd citie.</p>

<p>So when they came to the pallace of the viceroy, he was
not stirring, neither was the gate open, for as it hath beene
tolde you, it is open but once a day. Their guide seeing
that it would be somewhat long before that they would open
it, he carried the Spaniardes into a court of an other house,
which was ioyning vnto that of the viceroy.</p>

<p>In the meane while they were there, came all the iudges
to sit in audience, but when they vnderstoode of the comming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_168" id="Page_ii_168">[168]</a></span>
of the strangers, they commanded that they should be
brought before them; who greatly marueiled at the aspernesse
of their apparell, and not at any other thing, for that
they had seene there before the Austin fryers. Straightwayes
the gate of the pallace was open with great noyse of
artilerie and musicall instruments, as trumpets, bagpipes,
sackebuttes and hoybukes, with such a noyse that it seemed
the whole citie would sincke. At the entrie in the first court,
there were many souldiers armed, and had hargubushes and
lances, and in a very good order. In an other court more
within, which was very great, and railed round about with
timber, painted blacke and blew, which a far off seemed to
be yron, and was in height a mans stature; there they sawe
also many other souldiers, placed in the same order, and in
liuerie as the others were, but they seemed to be men of a
gallanter disposition. When they came into this court, there
was brought vnto them a commandement from the viceroy,
in the which they were commanded to returne and come
thether againe in the after noone, for that he could not speake
with them before, by reason of certaine businesse he had with
the lords of the counsell, which could not be deferred. With
this answere they departed out of the pallace, and returned
againe in the after noone, as they were commanded, and into
the same court aforesaide, out of the which they were carried
into a mightie great hall, very richly hanged and
adorned; at the ende thereof was three doores, that in the
middest was great, but the other two but small, the which
did correspond vnto other three doores that were in an other
hall more within, wherein was the viceroy, right over against
the doore in the middest, in at the which there is none permitted
to enter nor go foorth. Hee was set in a marueilous
rich chayre wrought with iuorie and gold, vnder a canopie
or cloth of state all of cloth of gold, and in the middest was
embrodered the kings armes, which were (as we haue said)
certaine serpents woond in a knot together. He had also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_169" id="Page_ii_169">[169]</a></span>
before him a table whereon were two candles burning, for
that it was somewhat late, and a standish with paper. Right
before the viceroy the wall was verie white, whereon was
painted a fearce dragon, who did throwe out fire at his
mouth, nose, and eyes, a picture (as was giuen them to
vnderstand) that all the iudges of that countrie commonly
hath it painted before their tribunall seates whereas they sit
in iustice, and is there to the intent to signifie vnto the iustice,
the fearcenesse that he should haue sitting in that seat for
to do iustice vprightly without feare or respect to any. The
order they haue in giving audience is with the ceremonies in
all points as it hath beene shewed you in the relation of the
fathers of S. Augustin. All people when they talke with the
viceroy are kneeling on their knees, although they be iudges
or loytias, as the fryers did see them many times.</p>

<p>This day, they seeing the Spaniardes remained looking
alwaies, when they should be commanded to enter in, the
viceroy gaue audience vnto the scriueners or notaries, to
certifie himselfe if they did their offices well, and commanded
fiftie of them at that present to be sotted or beaten for that
they were found culpable in their detayning of matters,
and others the like for that they had receiued giftes and
bribes of their clyents, the which is prohibited and forbidden
vnder greeueous penalties, for that the king doth
giue vnto them all sufficient stipend for their maintenance,
for that they should not incroch nor demand any
thing of their clyentes. The sots or stripes which were
giuen them were with great crueltie, and executed with certaine
canes, and in that order as in other places it hath beene
told you. The viceroyes gard were in number more than
two thousand men, placed all on a ranke, all apparelled in
one liuery of silke, and on their heads helmets of yron very
bright and glystering, and euerie one his plume of feathers.
These souldiers made a lane from the gate of the hall there
whereas the viceroy was, vnto the principal gate of the pallace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_170" id="Page_ii_170">[170]</a></span>
wheras they did first enter. Those which were in the
hals and vpon the staires had swords girt vnto them, and
they in the courtes had lances, and betwixt euery one of
them a hargubusher. All this gard (as was giuen them to
vnderstand) were Tartaros and not Chinos: but the reason
wherefore they could not learne, although they did inquire
it with diligence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniards are brought before the viceroy: he asketh of them certaine
questions, and doth remit them vnto the Timpintao his deputie, who
receiueth them well, and giueth them good speeches.</i></p></div>


<p>At that present came forth a seruant of the viceroyes, a
man of authoritie, and made signe vnto the Spaniards to enter
into the hall, instructing them that at the first entry they
should kneele downe on their knees: the which they did
presently: from that place vnto the seat of the viceroy was
more than a hundreth foot in length, yet did the viceroy
himself make signes with his hand that one of the religious
men should come nearer him, the which the father Costodio
did, and kneeled downe againe when he drew nigh vnto the
table that was before him. The viceroy did consider and
beholde him a good while, and that with great grauitie and
maiestie, and then asked him of whence he was, and what he
came to seeke in that kingdome, into the which none might
come vpon paine of death, without expresse licence of some of
the iudges alongst the sea coast. The father Costodio answered,
that he and the rest of his companions were Spaniards, and
that they were come into that kingdome mooued with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_171" id="Page_ii_171">[171]</a></span>
zeale of God, for the saluation of their soules, and for to
preach the holy gospell, and show them the way vnto heauen.
Hauing declared the interpreter this (although they did not
vnderstand whether he did vse fidelitie in the declaration or
not, but rather, by that which the viceroy did forthwith
demand, it is to be beleeued that he did it with falshood as
he had done many times before; for that without replying
vnto that which he had saide of the preaching of the gospel,
he asked them what marchandice they brought with them: the
said father answered, That they brought none, for that they
were not men that did deale in any marchandice, but in declaring
of things appertaining to heauen, and to direct their
soules to that place. Hearing this answere (or that which
the interpreter would imagine to be better for his purpose)
the viceroy did bid them depart, and commanded them to
returne againe the next day and to bring with them their
images, and the other things wherof he was certified from
Canton that were founde in their frigat, for that he would
see it all. They did accomplish his commandement, and returned
the next day in the morning, at such time as it was
tolde them that the pallace gates would be opened: the
which was done in the same maner and order as the day
before, with the noyse of musicke and artillerie as aforesaid.
So when that the viceroy was giuen to vnderstande how
that the Castillos were come, he commanded that one of them
with alonely the interpreter should enter there wheras he
was, and to bring in such thinges as he had commanded to
be brought, the which was presently accomplished. Hee
straightwaies began to looke vpon the images euery one by
it selfe, and the bookes: and made a stay betwixt euerie one
to consider well thereof, and made a showe of great content
he receiued in the sight of them. Although, aboue all the
rest, the ara of black iaspar did most content him, and caused
a marueilous strangenesse in the rest of the iudges that had
seene it. All this while was the father Costodio vpon his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_172" id="Page_ii_172">[172]</a></span>
knees, and the interpreter by him, and hee neuer asked of
them any question, neyther did they say any thing. They
that did bring those thinges vnto them for to see them,
seemed to be principall and ancient men, who, when they
gaue it him into his handes, they did it kneeling.</p>

<p>So after that he had seene them al at his pleasure, he commanded
to put them againe in the place that they were taken
out, and made signe vnto the father Costodio and to the
interpreter that they should depart, and to carry with them
al those things which they had brought. One of the ancient
men that were with him, did go foorth with the Spaniards,
and told them when they came into the second hall, that the
viceroye did reioyce much to see them, and all those which
they brought, and said that they should repaire vnto the
Timpintao, who was his deputy, and he would dispatch al
such matters as were asked of the viceroy by petition, following
the same till it was concluded, and that he would consult
with the viceroy, who would set down such orders as
shold be obserued. They straightwaies did put in execution
this order, and comming vnto the house of the deputie vnto
the viceroy, the which was very great and faire, they found
that he had a garde very little lesse than that of the viceroy,
and almost with as much maiestie. So after they had remained
in the court a good while, abiding his commandement
(to whom it was giuen to vnderstand that the viceroy
had sent them vnto him), he commanded them to ascend into
the place wheras he was, which was into a hall very well
dressed, in the which was almost al such things as they had
seene in the hall of the viceroy, and he himselfe in the same
manner sate in a rich chaire, with a table before him. He
commanded to take out those things which they brought in
their chestes, and did behold them with great consideration
peece by peece, as the viceroy had done, and reioysing much
to see the images, he did demande of them with curiositie
the signification of some of them, but in especiall a crucifix,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_173" id="Page_ii_173">[173]</a></span>
that after that he had considered with great attention, he
asked what man was that which was vppon the crosse, and
what those letters did signifie that were tituled ouer his head.
But when the father Costodio had declared it vnto him, he
beganne to laugh thereat, as though he had heard some
foolish fable. Hee came and feeled the habites of our religious
men, and made signes of great woonder to see the
aspernesse thereof.</p>

<p>The father Costodio seeing his affabilitie, and as it seemed
by outwarde showe that he did very much pitie them, he
requested to helpe and fauour him with the viceroy, and that
he would aske licence that they might remaine and dwell in
that countrie, in any place where his pleasure was to appoint,
for that they were men without any hurt, and would put all
their care and diligence to do workes of charitie, and to procure
that men might go to inioy the happie estate to the
which they were borne.</p>

<p>The interpreter dealt here in his office with as great
fidelitie as at other times, in saying that which the fathers
did request of him, was that he should be a meanes vnto the
viceroy that he would let them to remaine in that countrie
two or three moneths, for that as then it was an ill time to
nauigate the sea, and that without great danger of their
liues they could not returne vnto the Ilands Philippinas.
The iudge answered that they should not feare, but remaine
with content, for that he would procure that there should be
giuen them a house for those three or foure moneths, with a
commandement that none whatsoeuer should do them any
harme. The interpreter tolde them that the deputie to the
viceroy was very glad that they would remaine in that countrie,
for that they seemed vnto him men of good example
and necessarie in their common weale, and that they might
freely learne the language (as they sayd) for to shew and
instruct them the way vnto heauen. The Spaniards hauing
heard this, it made them very much to maruaile, and from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_174" id="Page_ii_174">[174]</a></span>
that time forwards they had good hope to prosecute that
which they did pretend. So with this and with great spirituall
and corporal ioy they tooke their leaue of the iudge,
and went vnto their lodging, wheras they gaue thanks vnto
God for the good directing of their busines, and did pray
vnto him to helpe them, that they might see a finall conclusion
of their desire. All this falsenes that the interpreter
did vse, was by the diuine permission (as afterwards they
did gather), when that by himselfe they were put out of all
doubt, and did declare what he did pretend by the way and
order he tooke. For without all doubt, if that the iudges
had plainely vnderstood that they would haue there remained,
they would not haue suffered them to haue entred
and seene the countrie. And the viceroy being aduertised
thereof, would haue caused them to depart in that troublesome
wether, whereas possibly they should haue beene all
drowned, for that the moneths of July, August, and September
in that countrie, are ordinarily full of stormes and
tempestes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniards remained certaine daies in Aucheo: they go to visite the
beautie of that citie, but in especiall the captaine generall of the sea,
who was so affectioned vnto the ara of blacke stone they brought, that
hee did with all care and diligence procure it of gift.</i></p></div>


<p>All the time that they remained in Aucheo, they did
occupie themselues in visiting of the principals of the court,
amongst whom he that did most reioice to see them was the
captaine generall of the men of war of that prouince, who
after that he had intreated them very friendly and louingly,
he desired them that they would returne the next day to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_175" id="Page_ii_175">[175]</a></span>
uisite him, and to bring with them the ara of blacke stone,
which they had shewed vnto the viceroy, that he might see
it, for that he had praised it very much: and to bring also
of their painted images. They did obey his commandement,
and came vnto him when that he was at dinner with great
maiestie. Then so soone as he had dined, he commanded
that they should enter into the hal there where he was. The
interpreter when he drew nigh vnto him did kneele down,
and made signes vnto the Spaniards to follow him and do the
like; but the captaine commanded them to arise and to couer
their heads, and did very much behold the ara or (altar
stone), making a showe of great admiration to beholde it:
hee demanded of the fryers many things of great curiositie,
and asked them if they would sell him that stone, and he
would giue them for it what they would demande. The
father Costodio answered, saying that they sold nothing, and
much lesse that, for that it was consecrated and dedicated to
the diuine colto (or sacrifice). The captaine replied and
saide, that if they would not sell it, that they should giue it
him, and hee would be gratefull vnto them in some other
thing, that they should thinke well of.</p>

<p>The father Costodio answered, that by no manner of
meanes he could not do it, for that vpon the same they did
celebrate and say masse, at such time as they did sacrifice
vnto the true God. At that instant the captaine did put his
handes vppon it to feele it, and the father Costodio made
signes vnto him to take away his handes, for that he sinned
greatly therein. Then he seeing that they would not giue it
him, he tooke his leaue, saying, that they should leaue it
there with him, for that hee would looke vpon it more at
leasure, promising to returne it them againe afterwardes.
The father Costodio did consent thereunto, but first he requested
him not to touch it with his handes.</p>

<p>So after that he had satisfied himselfe in the beholding of
it, his affection was then much more to remaine therewith:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_176" id="Page_ii_176">[176]</a></span>
and for to accomplish the same, not fayling of his word and
promise that he had made, hee deuised with himselfe a certaine
slight and policie, and sent for the father Costodio,
who came vnto him with great content, thinking verily that
he would haue returned their ara. When he came vnto him,
he did intertaine him verie ioyfully, and said that he was
vpon his iorney to certaine warres by the commandement of
the king, and that amongest those seruants that he carried
with him for his seruice, there were two christened Chinos,
which had beene captiues vnto the Portugales of the citie of
Machao, from whence they ran away, of whom he had had
vnderstanding in all thinges of the ceremonies of the Christians,
and that their comming thether was to baptise such as
would receiue the same: and hee being fully certified in
many thinges touching the same, he liked well thereof and
gaue great content, and hoped to be one of them that first
should receiue the faith when the king should grant licence
for the same.</p>

<p>All this (as it seemed) was that they should let him haue
the ara, vnto the which he was so affectioned, as aforesaid.
But the father Costodio vsed the matter in such sort
that hee got it out of his fingers, which was no small
matter. Within a few dayes after, the captaine being
readie to imbarke himselfe for to make his iourney, he
sent vnto the Spaniardes that two of them should come
vnto him, and that they should bring with them the
blacke stone, for there were certaine friendes of his that
would see it.</p>

<p>The father Costodio did straightwayes accomplish his commandement,
and carried with him the ara (or altar stone),
for that he durst not do otherwise, yet they did beleeue that
in giuing him some pretie or curious thing, they should content
him and quiet his mind: they carried also with them
the image of Marie Magdalen, made of feathers, which was
more woorthie than the ara (setting apart the consecration).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_177" id="Page_ii_177">[177]</a></span>
So when the religious fathers came wheras he was, he went
foorth to meete them more then tenne paces, with signification
of great ioy: and carrying them aside, he saide vnto
them once againe, that the captiues had told him so many
things of their vertuous maner of liuing, and of other things
touching the heauen, that he had great affection vnto them,
and desired that they might remaine in the countrie for to
baptise the inhabitants therof, and that he wold be the first:
but the cause wherfore he did delay the time is for to eschew
the paines that is pronounced against all those that do receiue
any law or strange ceremonie without particular licence of
the king. And for that he went in hast to go and inhabite a
certaine prouince, and that he was ready to depart; in the
which, so soone as it was possible, he would do so much that
al they should become Christians; and for as much as he
tolde him that the blacke stone (vnto the which he was
affectioned) was consecrated, that he would let him haue it
to carry with him, that he might put it in the first church
that the baptised should edifie, being made Christians: the
which would be very shortly, for that he was determined
before many daies to send to Machao for two friers such as
were there, to be fully informed of them in thinges touching
the Christian faith. Then the father Costodio sayde, if
that which he had spoken came from his heart, that hee
would foorthwith depart and goe with him and all his companie.</p>

<p>The captaine answered that as then hee could not doo it,
till such time as the church was built, and licence had for
the same of the king or vizroy, the which at that time he
coulde not demande, for the great hast that he had to depart.
The father Costodio replied and said, that his church
being built, he would promise him of his worde to sende it
him, and not to giue it to any other; and in pledge and
token of the same, he should carry with him the image of
Marie Magdalene made of feathers. The captaine receiued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_178" id="Page_ii_178">[178]</a></span>
the same with great content: greatlie maruelling at the subtill
and fine worke wherewith it was wrought: and after
did so much, that almost perforce he remained also with the
ara: and commanded to bee brought foorth two rich peeces
of damaske, and to giue them vnto the father Costodio for to
make an ornament in truck and ful satisfaction for the same;
but the father Costodio woulde not receiue them, but was
very much greeued to see howe that hee did remaine therewith,
and with the image of feathers. The captaine did contende
with him for to take the dameske, but hee would not.</p>

<p>Afterward they vnderstood that the interpreter was
bribed by a seruant of the captaines, for to alter the friers
words and to offer the captayne the ara, and any thing els
that hee would desire. For to the contrary he durst not by
any meanes to take it against the will of the fathers. To
conclude he did imbarke himselfe vpon his voyage, and
caried with him the ara and the image, with great ioy to
himselfe: but vnto the fathers and their companions discomfort
and sorrow, for they had lost the two thinges that they
so much esteemed. The captayne at his departure did vse
great thinges and curtesie, taking his leaue of them with
signes, that signified he bare them great loue and good will,
and that it greeued him to depart, and could not carie them
with him as they requested.</p>

<p>The interpreter did comfort the Spaniardes, and sayd that
they should not be sorrowful that the captaine had taken
those two pieces; for that he was a mightie prince, and that
he would fauour and helpe them with the vizroy, and that
hee was certaine that he would accomplish that which he
promised, that is, to become a Christian, for that he did
beare great good will and affection vnto them: in the which
the interpreter did not lie, for that it was told them by the
seruants of the captaine, that were christened, as I told you
before.</p>

<p>The frier Costodio remained so sad and sorowfull for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_179" id="Page_ii_179">[179]</a></span>
carrying away of the ara and Madlin of feathers, as though
he had lost a great treasure: and being desirous to recouer
them againe, he did recommend the same vnto S. Antonio de
Padua, who, for thinges that were lost, they knew by experience
to bee the onely saint for aduocate, and did promise
(the better to obtaine their desire) for to celebrate vnto him
certaine masses, when they should come into place fit for the
same.</p>

<p>Straightwayes it so fell out that the chiefe and principall
interpreter did fall out with the other that did helpe him,
about certaine profite that was comming to him, and did
threaten him that he would tell the gouernor howe that they
had giuen him much siluer for to conclude the matter about
the ara, for that the fathers had giuen it them more by force
then any good will. The interpreter fearing that hee shoulde
bee for the same greeuously punished, and finding himselfe
culpable in the things that the other threatned him for, he
went vnto the captain, who was imbarked and readie to depart,
tarrying onely for wether, and tolde him the falling out
in all points as it passed, and of his threatnings: who likewise
fearing what might succeede or happen, if it shoulde
come to the vnderstanding of the aytao of the cittie of
Canton, as could not be by any meanes excused: hee called
vnto him one of his seruants and commanded him to take the
ara and the image, and to carry them vnto the fathers, who
accomplished his commande, and they receiued them with
great comfort, and gaue great thankes vnto God for the same,
and S. Antonio de Padua: by whose intercession they beleeued
that they were restored.</p>

<p>The next day following, which was the thirde day of September,
the timpintao did sende to call the Spaniards before
him, who as we haue said was deputie vnto the vizroy, and
he gaue them certaine dispatches, in saying, that there was
in them all that they did aske, and gaue commandement to
the gouernor of Canton that he should not neglect, but accomplish
al things therin comprehended, so that they might
depart when they pleased. When hee tooke his leaue of
them, hee did intreate them verie curteously with words of
great curtesie. The Spaniards departed his presence with
incredible ioy: beleeuing that he had agreed and granted
all that they did aske, and to remaine in the countrie to

had shewed them so much fauour, and that the same was
committed to his charge, for the execution of his commission,
that they should perswade themselues that hee would performe
it according vnto his commandement, without failing
anie thing. And for to beginne the same, hee shewed vnto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_181" id="Page_ii_181">[181]</a></span>
them a house of the kings which should be for their dwelling,
which was in the suburbs halfe fallen downe, and there
they were lodged, with a commandement that they should
not go foorth, neither enter into the cittie without particular
licence. Heere they remained many dayes being deceiued
of their purpose, and maruelled very much that the gouernor
would not giue them licence for to reedifie a monastery,
neither for to enter into the cittie for to giue order in that
which they beleeued was granted them by the vizroy, til
such time as they vnderstood what was done by their interpreters,
and relation giuen by the Chino boy which came
with them from the Philippinas, who declared to them the
truth in all things: how that the interpreters had neuer told
the iudges how that they would remain in the countrie,
neither made any mention thereof, but that they came thither
as lost men, and that their request was to remaine in the
country til it were faire wether, or the comming of the Portugall
shippes. And this was that which the vizroy and his deputie
had granted, and no other thing. But when the father
Costodio and his companions (who verely beleeuing that their
desire woulde take effect) vnderstoode the craft and wile
of the interpreters, and the great falshood that they had vsed,
they were very sadde, and beganne amongst themselues to
remedie the same: so they determined to seeke a new interpreter,
one that should faithfulle and truely declare their will
vnto the gouernor. And although they did finde some that
could doo it, for that they did reasonably vnderstande the
Portugall tongue, yet there were none that woulde accept it,
for any request or giftes that they did promise them.</p>

<p>The father Costodio seeing this, and that the time appointed
did passe away without doing of any thing, one day hee and
the rest of his companions did ioine togither, and entred in
counsell to see what was best to be done, according vnto
the necessitie in the which they were driuen. There was
amongst them diuers opinions, for that of the father Costodio
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_182" id="Page_ii_182">[182]</a></span>
and of another religious man was, that they woulde go vnto
Machao, which was not farre off, and there would administer
the sacraments, and preach the holy gospel vnto the christened
Chinos, and to learne the China language, and to tarrie
there and abide the first occasion that should bee offered, or
else they themselues to procure it, for, hauing the language,
it were an easie thing to doo it: and they should not haue
neede of any interpreter, neither feare to be deceiued as they
had beene before. And besides this, they put the Portugals
out of all doubt of the false opinion that the captaine generall
had published abroade of them, and of other matters of like
effect and purpose. The other two religious men and souldiers
were of a contrarie opinion: which was, that they
should returne vnto the Ilands Philippinas, and not vnto
Machao, and saide, that they had departed without licence
of the gouernor, and did aduenture themselues into the
harme and damage that might happen vnto them by that
enterprise, and all for to plant the faith of Christ in that
kingdome. And now seeing that by the iust iudgement of
God wee cannot put it in execution, wee are greatly bounde
to returne againe vnto him, of whome we doubt not but with
ease to get our pardon for the error passed, representing the
zeale wee had to the honour of God, and the saluation of so
manie soules, who did incite vs to giue that great enterprise:
with the which we shall remaine blamelesse with them that
had giuen wrong iudgement of vs, and accomplish our
bounden duetie and obedience which wee doo owe vnto the
gouernor. And in going vnto Machao wee shall runne in
great danger to be holden and iudged for traitors to the
king: and the intent wherewith wee went vnto China, euery
one wil construe and interpret thereon at his pleasure.</p>

<p>The resolution of these contrary opinions, was by a common
consent delated certaine dayes, in the which they prayed
vnto God to put into their hearts that which was best for His
deuine seruice. So in the end the father Costodio, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_183" id="Page_ii_183">[183]</a></span>
religious man, who was of his opinion, did determine to go
forwards with their pretence, and to go vnto Machao, as
aforesaid, and the rest to returne vnto the ilands with the
first oportunitie they might finde: but when it should come
to effect, one of the religious friers that shoulde haue gone
vnto Manilla was deade of an infirmitie that chanced him.
They staid there longer then they did think they should, by
reason that the iudges of the cittie were occupied with the
examinations of students, the which is accustomed euery
three yeares, and is in that manner and order as hath beene
tolde you in the proper chapter for the same: the which
examinations endured more then fiue and fortie dayes, with
great feastes and banquets, without medling in any other
particular businesse.</p>

appertaining unto them.</i></p></div>


<p>In the meane time of this their examination, the father
Costodio did sende a messenger vnto the bishop of Machao,
declaring vnto him his determination, and he also did write
vnto the deuout priest, of whome we haue made mention
before, and craued of them their almes wherewith they might
make prouision for them that would depart for the Ilands
Philippinas, and how that he and his companyon would go
and see his lordship. This was not done so secretly, but it
came vnto the vnderstanding and knowledge of the captaine
generall of the Portugals, who with great choller went and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_184" id="Page_ii_184">[184]</a></span>
demanded the letters of the priest, those that were giuen him
by the Chino: threatning him that if hee did not, hee woulde
punish him with great rigor, and banish him out of the countrie
as a suspected person. He answered him, that of truth
he had receiued certaine letters, but that at the very instant
hee sent them vnto the bishoppe vnto whom they were directed:
about the which there was great holde and keepe,
vntill it came to effect that the captaine did lay holde vppon
the priest for to apprehende him: but when the bishop
vnderstood thereof, hee with all speede possible went to
remedy the danger that might insue, and to take him out of
his power.</p>

<p>The captaine seeing that hee could not perseuer with his intent
and purpose, he made many notifications vnto the bishop,
requiring that he would not permit that any letters shoulde bee
receiued from those religious Spaniards, for that he knew by
very certaine relation that they were spies, and no friers; and
if so be that any damage should happen vnto them, by their
order, that hee woulde lay the whole fault vppon him as a
consenter and a helper. The bishoppe answered that he was
fully perswaded and certified that they were true religious
men, and seruants of God, and that he with a very good will
would take vpon him the burthen of any damage that should
happen to the country by their meanes, or vnto the king of
Portugall. With this the captaine was somewhat quieted,
but not so much but that continually hee did not let to imagine
newe matters against the poore fathers, to haue occasion
to apprehend them, and imagined in his minde for to write
a letter vnto the interpreters, in the which hee did offer them
great quantities of money, if that they would do so much as
giue order that the iudges woulde sende the religious men
and Spanish souldiers that were in Canton vnto the cittie of
Machao, aduertising them howe and which way they shoulde
vse the matter to put it in effect, and was, that he should tell
the iudges, that the first time when as they went to speake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_185" id="Page_ii_185">[185]</a></span>
with the gouernor, whereas they did aske and say that they
would depart for the Ilands Philippinas, that they did interpret
it contrary, for that their demand was for to go vnto
Machao.</p>

<p>The interpreters straightwayes (with the desire of gaine)
did take the charge vppon them, and did vse the matter in
such sort that the iudges did sende them vnto Machao, whether
it were with or against their willes. But God, who
woulde not permit those his seruantes and Christians to bee
deceiued, remedied the same at such time as it should haue
beene put in execution, in the manner as you shall vnderstande
in the chapter following.</p>

<p>Being vnderstood by a Portugall, a good Christian of the
towne of Machao, of such things as the captaine generall did
imagine against the poore religious fathers that were in
Canton, and their companions the souldiers, of whose holy
zeale he was fully certified, and being greeued at the very
soule that one Christian shoulde hurt and harme another:
and more in the disturbing of the saluation of soules, hee
determined with himselfe to giue them aduice therof with
all speed that was possible, as in effect hee did by sending
them a letter without anie name: wherein he gaue them to

did pretende that they should be sent thither
wheras he might apprehend them, and send them vnto the

with some false information, and willed them to be wel aduised,
and to keepe themselues from the deceit ordained.</p>

<p>The letter being seene, and wel aduised of all that was
therein contained, they determined to giue notice thereof
vnto a Chino, a verie friende of theirs, and perfite in the

had doone them friendshippe: who promised them that
before many houres, he would bring al things to light, and
to know whether that were true or not.</p>

sit in audience, and was there as one that knew nothing,
vntill such time as he saw come thither one of the interpreters
with a petition in his hand, and presented it vnto the
supreme iudge, who was the Aytao, and which being read by
a scriuener, hee prouided that all things should be granted
and doone, that was therein contained. This petition the
Chino aforesaid saw; and after that the interpreter was
departed with contentment, and found that in the same petition
he did request (in the name of the Spaniards) of the
iudge to giue them leaue for to go vnto Machao, which was
more for their purpose then to go vnto the Ilands Philippinas,
which was granted by the iudge, and lacking nothing
but to seale or signe the petition, but was delated vntil the
euening, by reason of certaine businesse that chanced at that
present: but sure it was the ordinance of God, for that if it
had beene signed, they must needs of force haue accomplished
the same, without any replication. So with this certaintie
he went straightwayes vnto the Spaniards, to whom
the interpreter had told that by petition he had asked licence
for them to go to the Ilands Philippinas from whence they
came; but the iudge woulde not graunt vnto that, but for to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_187" id="Page_ii_187">[187]</a></span>
go vnto Machao, which was neerer hand, who commanded
them to accomplish the same without any replication, vppon
paine that they should be carried thither perforce.</p>

<p>The Spaniards asked councell of the Chino their friende,
what meanes might be taken to auoide the danger that the
interpreter had begun to bring them in, and was alredie
gone to conclude the same. The Chino said that he was
fully perswaded that the Aytao loued them well, and that he
vnderstood hee did them great fauour and courtesie to graunt
vnto the petition the which the interpreter did present in
their name. But notwithstanding for so much as it was not
signed, there was remedie to bee had, if that they woulde
present another which hee would giue them, and go presently
vnto the Aytao and present the same, and say when
they giue it him, that they woulde go vnto Luzon and not
vnto Machao, and that he himselfe would go with them for
the good will he bare vnto them, if it were not for the great
paine that is put vppon all them whosoeuer that shall speak
for any stranger, without licence of the iustice, or is called and
ordained for the same. So they being fully perswaded in
this conclusion, with the petition made and all ready, there
entred in at the gate wheras they were, a seruant to the
Aytao, who in the behalfe of his master came to cal the Spaniards
to come before him, for that he would see and talke
with them before their departure. They straightwayes went
forth in his company, and came vnto the gates of the cittie,
after they had gon a good wayes in the suburbs: and there
they were staied till such time as another came and brought
their licence, written vpon a table (in such sort as in other
places it hath beene told you). So when they had passed
the gate, they passed thorough a long street, in the which
they saw so great riches, and of so great curiosity, that the
father Costodio with great admiration said, I haue beene in
the principallest citties of all Flanders and Italie, and in all
them I haue not seene so great curiositie and riches as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_188" id="Page_ii_188">[188]</a></span>
this streete alone: and according vnto the report of them all,
hee had great reason to maruell thereat. So they comming
vnto the end of this streete, and in sight of another gate,
they sawe that the souldiers which kept and garded the same,
did shut them in their presence with great hast, and let fall
a percullis of yron before the gate, and demanded to see
their licence at a window out of the saide percullis: and
when they had it, although they saw with them the seruant
of the Aytao and the interpreter, yet would they not open
the gate vntill such time as it was acknowledged and newe
firmed by another iudge; the which being done, they presently
did open the gates and did conduct them vnto the
house of one which is to be compared to a iudge of the court,
and called in their language Tequisi, that he might go with
them to the Aytao, for so it was commanded and ordained. Unto
this Tequisi they gaue their petition that they had made, without
giuing the interpreter to vnderstand therof, requesting
him by signes and some words which they had learned of the
language that he woulde giue it to the Aytao, and to procure
that hee might accept and grant that which by the same they
did demand. But when they gaue it him, it caused great
alteration in the interpreter, for that they told the iudge that
he was a theefe and a traitor, and how that he had sold them
to the captaine general of Machao, and how that hee had
presented a petition in their name: howe that they would
go thither, and not to the iland of Luzon, where all their
desire is to returne, and this hath he done by gifts that the
saide captaine general hath promised to giue him, if that he
do accomplish his desire. The Tequisi when he heard this,
he forthwith departed with vs from his owne house, towards
the house of the Aytao which was hard by, and as he went by
the way he read their petition, and sawe that it was different
to that which the interpreter had giuen before vnto the
Aytao, he being present: whereat he made a stay and began
to consider of the same, as also of that which the Spaniards had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_189" id="Page_ii_189">[189]</a></span>
said vnto him at such time as they gaue him their petition, for
by the signes and tokens they made, as by their semblant in
speech, it seemed to him that they were marvellouslly indigned
against the interpreter; but he did not wel vnderstand them, for
that they could not plainly declare it in their language, till
such time as hee found the contrarietie that was in the petitions,
and the turbation of the interpreter, whom presently
hee called vnto him, and asked him what the matter was?
Hee trembling for feare, answered and saide, that hee vnderstood
that the father Costodio (whome all the rest doo obey
as their head, and with whom he alonely did communicate),
that it was his pleasure, and gaue order to go vnto Machao,
and that hee was certaine that all the rest were of that
opinion, wherein he thought he had done well, and therefore
he presented that petition in asking licence, whereby
they might doo it liberallie, with this discharge. And againe
the Spaniards seeing how he was terrified, and how that he
requested them so humblie they would not proceed any farther
with their complaint, wherewith the Tequisi was satisfied,
who said vnto the Spaniards being in the gallerie of the
Aytao his house, that they shoulde tarry there, and hee entred
in with the petition in his hand. So within a while after
they were commanded to enter into the hall there whereas
the iudges were, and had seene the petition and had comoned
about the same. And at their entring into the hall whereas
the Aytao was, there were signes made vnto them that they
should kneele downe, the which they did almost twenty
paces before they came to the table that was before him: hee
had in hande the petition that Tequisi had giuen vnto him,
and although that he had read it before, yet did he returne
and looked againe vppon it, and asked which were they that
would go vnto Machao. The father Costodio signified himselfe
and frier Iohn Baptista his companion; and said, that
they, for that they were old and timorous of the sea, they
would go thither for that it was nearer hande, and howe that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_190" id="Page_ii_190">[190]</a></span>
the rest that were not of such yeares, neither so timorous,
they woulde returne vnto the iland of Luzon from whence
they came, and there dwell with other of their brethren and
friends that were there. The interpreter, whose euill conscience
did accuse him for the euils which he had done, was
so timorous, that all men might see plainly his default, and
without al doubt the iustices are so right in executing the
same, that if their complaint had gone forwards, they would
haue punished him and his companion, and that very cruelly:
but the religious friers woulde not consent that the souldiers
shoulde declare against them, although their will was good,
but thought it a sufficient punishment to see in what affliction
the poore men were in, and tooke pittie on them.</p>

<p>The Aytao was desirous to see their images and book,
which was the chiefest occasion wherefore hee sent to call
them; and when he saw them he receiued great content, and
called the father Costodio to come nigh vnto him, and asked
the signification of some of them, such as seemed vnto him
most strangest, and being satisfied thereof, hee commanded
the frier Costodio to reade on one of these bookes, hee harkening
vnto it with great attention, and as one amased to see
those letters, and the forme of them so farre different vnto
theirs, which are all in manner of caractes, as hath beene
told you. So after that they had passed away the time a
while in this, hee saide, that those which woulde go vnto
Machao shoulde put themselues on the one side, and they
that woulde go vnto Luzon on the other: the which being
doone hee tooke his leaue of them verie louinglie, and saide
that hee would giue them the licence which they did aske at
all times whensoeuer they woulde, and although hee coulde
not grant it them without first to consult with the vizroy of
Aucheo, yet he would doo it within tenne dayes, and then
those which woulde go vnto Macheo might presently depart,
and those which would go vnto Luzon, he would send them
vnto Chincheo, that from thence the gouernour shoulde
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_191" id="Page_ii_191">[191]</a></span>
cause them to be sent in the first passage that goeth with
merchandice.</p>

<p>This Aytao was very peaceable and humaine, who hauing
compassion on the Spaniards, for that they seemed vnto him
to be good men, he commanded to bee giuen to them, ouer
and aboue the kings alowance, a hogge, and rice, and other
kind of victuals. So herewith they went vnto their lodgings
with content, and also the interpreter, who thought that hee
was newe borne againe that day.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_II_XIII" id="CHAP_II_XIII"></a>CHAP. XIII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniards remaine certaine dayes in Canton, whither came certaine
Portugals from, Machao: at the first they feared them, but afterwards
they were assured, by the contractation they had the one with the other,
that they were friendes: the vizroy of Aucheo commeth to Canton,
and dispatcheth the Spaniards, and giueth them good prouision and
intertainment.</i></p></div>


<p>After that the ten daies were past appointed by the Aytao,
and some more, and seeing that no more mention was made
them, but as though they had neuer seene them, they were
very sorowfull, and in ielousie that the captaine general of
Machao aforesaide had knowledge howe that his craft and
subtiltie was discouered, and thereupon to begin and frame
some other: procuring for an instrument in the performing
of the same, some iudge or some other person of power and
authoritie. So they being with this care and discontent,
there came vnto the cittie of Canton foure Portugals to buy
and sell merchandice, with a safe conduct which they had
for the same, which was the occasion that their sorow and
trouble increased, suspecting what might happen conformable
to the aduise which they had from thence: but for that
they did comon and visit them many times, with intent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_192" id="Page_ii_192">[192]</a></span>
discouer their minds the one vnto the other, they presently
did forget the euill suspection that they had of them, and not
onely that, but they did giue them great almes and charitie,
helping and aiding them in all things, as it was meete and
reason amongst Christians. So being void of their first care,
they put all their diligence and care in their departure: and
seeing that there was no mention made thereof, by reason that
the iudges were occupied in mustering the souldiers of that
circuit in a great and mightie field, whereas they were trained
vp in military exercises, some shooting in bowes, some with
hargabushes, tossing the pike, running of horses, and many
other exercises more: and after that they had many different
proofes, as well of thinges past as at that present, they ordained
captaines, such as were aduanced aboue all the rest,
and most worthy: all which being finished, the Spaniards
determined to put the Aytao in remembrance of his promise;
and the better that they might doo it, and with most breuitie,
they ordained a petition, and went with the same vnto the
house of the Aytao, therewith to aske licence to put it in vre.
The first iudge they met withall was the Tequisi aforesaid,
who made signes that they should come vnto him, and
asked of them what they would haue. The father Costodio
answered, nothing but onely to present that petition vnto
the Aytao, to put him in minde of their departure: the
Tequisi did take the petition, promising them to giue it vnto
him presently, the which he did accomplish in a short space.
So being read by the Aytao, he made answere by the same
petition, that he had a particular care of them, and tarried
onely for order from the vizroy, which could not tarrie long:
the receiuing whereof hee woulde aduertise them; the which
hee did accomplish in fewe dayes, which came with great
content vnto the Spaniards, for that he commanded that they
should be sent away in verie good order, and to giue them
all that was needfull for their iourney, and that in aboundance.
The same day that this commission came, there came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_193" id="Page_ii_193">[193]</a></span>
also newes that the vizroy would come vnto the cittie of
Canton, and that within few dayes hee would bee there: the
which did so much trouble the Aytao and the rest of the
iudges, that day and night they neuer rested, but were occupied
in the preparing al things necessary to receiue him,
which were so many and with so great maiestie as though
the king in person should come thither: with great and
mighty triumphall arkes, rich hangings, with other things,
the which I do not here make mention of, although they
were very curious, because I would not be tedious, for that
I haue a great desire to conclude this little historie: and if
I should declare all that passed therin, it were requisite for
the same alone to make a great volume.</p>

<p>Foure dayes after the comming of the vizroy, by his order
there was giuen both to the one and to the other a prouision,
in the which he commanded all iudges and gouernors to receiue
the Spaniards into their iurisdictions whereas they
should passe, and not to permit any to do them harme or
iniury, but to giue them free passage with securitie till such
time as they should come to the place appointed in the said
prouision, which was vnto Machao and vnto Luzon: and
iointly therewith he commanded two captaines to beare them
company til such time as they had brought them out of all
danger. And to giue vnto them that went vnto Machao
(which was three daies iourney) sufficient prouision requisite
for fiue dayes: and to them that went to Luzon their prouision
for forty dayes, although the voyage is to be made in
fifteene dayes, and in twentie dayes at the most. He also
commanded them that had the charge to carry them, that
they shoulde haue a special care vnto their healthes, in
trauelling not too fast, but little and little. Likewise the
Aytao gaue order vnto the interpreters for to sell the frigat,
in the which the fathers came thither, and to giue vnto them
the price that shoulde bee made thereof, to bestow it at their
pleasure: the which they did, but kept still the halfe of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_194" id="Page_ii_194">[194]</a></span>
which they solde it for: and with many other things more,
which by the commandement of the vizroy was giuen them
for their iourney, and thought it well bestowed on them, for
to see themselues free of their lyings and crafts. At the
departure of the father Costodio, one of the souldiers mind
was altred, who was called Pedro de Villa Roel, and was
very desirous to go with him vnto Machao, the which hee
did accomplish by apparelling himself in the habite of a Portugal,
because he had no licence to go otherwise. So all
things being in a redinesse for their iourney, they tooke
their leaue the one of the other, in shedding many teares
with the griefe of minde.</p>

<p>The father Costodio and his companions came safely and
in health to Machao in foure dayes, as himselfe did afterwards
write thereof, and were very well receiued of the
bishop, and of all the rest: and within fewe dayes after they
gaue them a place for to build a monasterie, wherein he and
his companion might liue, and all such as should take the
habite of that order. They came thither the fifteenth of
Nouember.</p>

<p>And those which went vnto Luzon departed out of the
cittie of Canton in a great barke, of the which there are
many in all that kingdome, very well tilted and dressed,
with many roomes and galeries and painted windowes, as
hath beene told you: in the which they were very much
made of by the patron of the said barke and of the passengers,
which were many, and went vnto diuers partes with
merchandice: some thinges that they saw by the way till
they came vnto Chincheo, shal be told you in the chapter
following.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_II_XIV" id="CHAP_II_XIV"></a>CHAP. XIV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They that were determined to go vnto Luzon, doo departe for the cittie of
Chincheo: in which voyage they see many riuers and townes: and
other particular things.</i></p></div>


<p>The Spaniards depart out of the riuer of Canton, and
after they had sailed by sea the space of three leagues, they
entred into another mighty riuer, in the which they trauelled
four daies. And sure the great number of citties and townes
that they saw alongst the riuers side is incredible, and so
nigh the one vnto the other, that they seemed to be al one:
so in the end of foure dayes they landed at one of the cities,
where came so much people to see those strangers, that it
seemed al the kingdome were there assembled together, and
were so many in number, that before they could get to the
inne wheras they should be lodged, there passed more then
foure houres, and was in distance but a quarter of a league:
but when they came thither, they were verie faint with the
great thrust and throng of the people. They stayed in this
cittie one day, and the next day, very early in the morning,
was brought vnto them horse, for to trauel by land other two
daies, the which was almost continually in villages and
townes; and the third day they were imbarked in a smal
barke, wherein they passed a riuer which had but litle water,
the space of two houres; then after they were shipped in a
bigger barke, and entred into another riuer, which seemed
to be an arme of the sea, in the which they sailed fiue dayes,
and sawe sailing vp and downe the said riuer so many barks
and boats, that it made them to be greatly amased. These
riuers were as wel replenished of cities and townes, as the
other riuer whereof we haue spoken. Al which is a helpe
to beleeue that which hath been said of the mightinesse and
the great number of people that are in that mighty kingdom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_196" id="Page_ii_196">[196]</a></span>
Concluding this riuer they entred into another, but not so
broade as the last, but a swifter current, and beset with
mightie trees both on the one side and the other, and were so
thick that almost they could not see the sunne thorough them:
and although the country was very asper there alongst the
riuers side, yet was there many walled citties, and an infinite
number of townes and vilages, in such sort that the suburbs
did almost ioyne the one vnto the other. So when they were
disembarked out of this riuer, they trauelled by land other
foure dayes, and greatly maruelled to see the great fertilitie
of the country, and many other things more, which they do
passe ouer, for that in the relation of the Augustine friers it
hath beene declared vnto you. In the ende of those foure
daies they came to a cittie ten leagues from Chincheo, and
were lodged in the suburbs of the same, whether resorted so
much people to see them, that although they did shut the
gates to defend themselues from the prease, yet could they
not be disturbed of the entry, for that they broke the gates,
and climed vp the wals and windowes to see them. The host of
the house whereas they were lodged, when he saw that the
people did spoile and destroy his house, he requested the Spaniards
to go forth into a greene fielde which was there harde by,
placed amongst a company of orchards, the which they did
to satisfie them, and also to satisfie the multitude of people
that were come thither only to see them. The noise of the
people was so great, that the gouernor feared there had bin
some other matter, and commanded a iudge to go and examine
the cause and know the truth: but when that hee was
certified thereof, hee commaunded the Spaniards to come
vnto his house, for that hee was desirous and would see
them. They presently did accomplish his commandement,
and went their way, and as they passed thorough the streete,
there were certaine representing a comedie, but so soone as
the people that were there did see the Spaniardes, they left
the players all alone and followed them. They entred into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_197" id="Page_ii_197">[197]</a></span>
the gouernors house, and found him with great maiestie of
seruants and souldiers of his gard: he entertayned them with
great loue, and asked them who they were, and from whence
they came. The interpreter presently showed the prouision
they brought from the viceroy, which was, in summe, their
licence giuen by him for them to go vnto Chincheo, and that
none should disturbe them in their iourney, but to ayde and
giue them all fauour possible, and that which was needefull
for their iourney. And when that he had read the same, he
saide that thereby he did vnderstand that which he desired
to know, and how that the viceroy did command all gouernors,
and him as one of them, they should offer to do all that
lay in them: the which he did accomplish, and shewed them
great fauour and friendship.</p>

<p>The next day following, they departed out of this citie by
land, being giuen vnto them by the gouernor very good prouision
for the way. The same day they came vnto a towne
that was very fresh, and fiue leagues from the place they departed,
they were determined to tarrie all that night, fearing
the passage through a citie which was but a league
before, suspecting that they should be as much troubled with
the people as they were in the other citie the day before. And
although this was but a small towne, yet was there so great
a concourse of people that came from the villages there
abouts, that it caused them to depart the next morning more
early than they thought, and all the night they could not
sleepe, because of the great noyse of the people.</p>

<p>So within a while after they departed from that towne,
they came vnto the citie aforesaide, the which for situation
and gallant buildings, was the fairest in all that province.
Through the midst thereof ranne a mightie riuer, ouer the
which were many bridges very great and most faire. Here
were they so oppressed with much people that came to see
them, that they were detayned in the presse a good while
before they could enter into the citie: and after they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_198" id="Page_ii_198">[198]</a></span>
within they were compassed about in such sort, that they
could not goe to seeke to eate, but were constrained to enter
into a barke and go downe the riuer and shroud themselues
amongst a company of trees, and although they did vse this
policie, yet the number of people were so great that leapt
into the same barke that they were readie to sinke, till such
time as they who had entred the barke, to auoid that perill,
returned and lept a shoore, leauing them all alone with the
barkemen and marriners that did rowe, who went to seeke
and bring them to eate, and they remained in the barke all
that night.</p>

<p>So the next day in the morning, before the people could
come to disturbe them, they rowed towards the great and
huge citie of Chincheo, and entred into the same vppon a
Sunday, in the morning, being the sixt day of December.</p>

<p>They remained still in the barke for their owne quietnesse
and security, and sent their interpreter with their prouision
vnto the Gouernour, that he might ordaine at his pleasure
that which was therein commanded. The Gouernour when
he had receiued commission he said vnto the interpreter that
he should tell the Spaniards that he was very glad that they
were come thither in safetie and in good health, and that
hee should receiue great ioy to see them, and to shew them
the courtesie that was commanded him by the viceroy, in
their prouision or commission. But by reason that the great
number of people that would come to see them, should not
be troublesome vnto them, he would passe ouer his content in
seeing them, and for their better comoditie they shall depart
in the same barke wherein they came, vnto the port of
Aytim, whereat were certain ships that were bound vnto
Luzon, and that he would command they should be receiued
into the said ships, and to be carried with as much speede
as was possible: and for the accomplishing of the same hee
kept the commission of the viceroy, and gave an other commission
vnto the gouernor of the port, whether as hee sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_199" id="Page_ii_199">[199]</a></span>
them, in the which he commanded to be accomplished all
that he had promised.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, although they would very gladly have
seene the citie of Chincheo and the mightinesse thereof, yet
did they accomplish that which the gouernor did command
without anie reply, for that they considered that it should
come then better to passe. So they came vnto the said port
the next day folowing in the morning, whereas they did
remaine in the barke, doing as they did at Chincheo, and
sent their interpreter with the commission vnto the gouernor,
who presently after he had read the same, sent and
commanded that the Spaniards should come a shore and
come and see him: who did accomplish the same, although
with no lesse trouble than in other places, by reason of the
people that came to see them. The gouernor intertained
them with great loue and faire words, and before they departed
from him, he sent to call a captaine of one of the ships
that was there bound unto Luzon, and asked of him when
he would depart from that place, who answered within ten
daies: then the gouernor commanded that he should carrie
them in his ship, and to giue them the best intertainement
that was possible, who promised him to accomplish the
same, and therwith he tooke his leaue of them, and sent
them with the said captaine, who offered them all the fauour
and friendship that was requisite. He presently carried
them vnto his ship, who after he had shewed them the whole
commoditie therof, he made them a colation or banket with
great friendship.</p>

<p>They remained in this port more than fifteene daies,
wheras they suffered very much colde, and seeing that the
ship wherein they were appointed to go was not redie, neither
any order for them to depart in many daies, considering
the great desire they had to be amongst their own nation
and to take their ease, and hauing knowledge of another
ship that was ready and would depart, they altogither went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_200" id="Page_ii_200">[200]</a></span>
vnto the gouernor (who was set in audience), and said vnto
him with a loud voice (as is vsed in al that countrie), that
the captaine whom he had commanded to carrie them vnto
Luzon, was not readie to depart, neither any signe that he
would in many daies, and that he would giue them licence,
and command a captaine of an other ship that was there readie
to depart, and went vnto the same Iland of Luzon, that he
might carrie them, because they were so ill at ease, and suffered
so much colde that they felt great griefe.</p>

<p>When the gouernor heard this he was very angry, and
with great choler he commaunded one of his officers that was
there with him, to go presently and bring before him that
captaine vnto whom he had committed the carriage of the
Spaniards: the which was accomplished, and that in so short
time that it caused great wonder: who when he came before
the gouernor had so great feare, that he knew not whether
he was in heaven or in earth. The gouernor straightwaies
asked him what was the occasion that he did not depart
within the tenne daies as he had sayde? The captaine
answered, that they had had no wether, neither at that present,
wherewith they might nauigate. He asked him againe
and saide, seeing that the weather and time would not serue,
how is it that there is an other ship readie to depart. The
captaine at this demand did faulter in his speech, and
answered friuolous wordes, wherefore the gouernor commanded
that he should be whipped in his presence for the
lie which he had tolde; and as they were pulling off his
appareil for to execute the commandement, the Spaniards
hauing pitie and compassion of him, for that he seemed to
be an honest man, they fell all vpon their knees at the gouernors
feete, and requested him to pardon his offence, who did
presently consent therunto with a good will, and commanded
to let him alone; but he spake vnto him very sharpe wordes,
such as, so farre foorth as the Spaniardes could perceiue by
the semblance both of the one and of the other, that was as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_201" id="Page_ii_201">[201]</a></span>
much griefe vnto him as though he had beene whipped.
Then presently he commanded to call the captaine of that
ship that was readie to depart, and deliuered vnto him the
commission that he had giuen vnto the other, with a great
penaltie, and charged him to carrie the Spaniards vnto the
Ilande of Luzon, and charged him to bring a testimoniall
from thence, how that he had carried them in very good
order and saftie, and left them at the place that they desired.
This captaine vnderstanding what had passed with the other,
and because he would not see himselfe in the like perplexitie,
did accept the commandement, and thought the time long of
his departure from thence, and did promise them more than
they did demand, and made hast to depart out of the hauen
because hee would not be called backe againe.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniards depart from China and go to Luzon, they do passe some
stormes at the sea: the mariners do call vpon the diuell, by lots:
the religious men do reprehend them: in the end they come to their
desired port, whereas they are received with much ioy.</i></p></div>


<p>The second day of Januarie, departed out of the porte of
Aytim, with a prosperous wind, the shippe wherein was
imbarked the Spaniardes, and two other which were their
safe conduct: but by reason it was winter, the faire winde
indured but a while, yet came they that day vnto the islande
of Amoy, which was sixe leagues from the firme lande, and
there they stayed one day. The next day following they
went to sea, to prosecute their voyage, whereas they were
taken with so terrible and foule weather, that the ship did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_202" id="Page_ii_202">[202]</a></span>
driue they knew not whither, and many times in daunger to
be drowned. This storme indured four dayes, although
more stronger at one time than at an other: in the which
storme was separated the three ships, the one from the other,
in such sort, that euery one tooke his way, procuring to saue
themselves, as commonly in such cases is vsed, without
hauing any care the one of the other; and God was so
pleased that the ship wherein the Spaniardes were, and one
of the other two, entered into a sure port, although with
great trouble and with so great a leake, that they could
scarce keepe her aboue water; but in especiall that which
came in their safe conduct. And afterwarde they understood
that the other ship had taken port fiftie leagues from that
place, with the like perill and danger. In this port they
remained certaine dayes trimming their ships, and tarrying
for a faire winde. So they departed from thence the three
and twentie day of Januarie, and to their iudgementes with
a settled and good winde, with the which they sayled fiue
dayes, in the end whereof they discouered the iland of
Luzon, with a singular ioy unto them all, for which the
Spaniards gaue thanks vnto God, by whose fauour they had
escaped the storme past.</p>

<p>But it so fell out, as they were going alongest the coast of
the iland for to enter into the port of Manilla, and being
within fiue leagues of the entrie thereof, vpon a soddaine
there arose the north wind with so great furie, and caused
so great a sea, that they found themselues in a great deale
more daunger than in the other storme past, in such sort that
they sponed<a name="FNanchor_1_44" id="FNanchor_1_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> before the winde with their foresayle halfe mast
hie, shaking it selfe to pieces, and in euerie minute of an
houre readie to be drowned. The Chinos, for that they are
superstitious and witches, beganne to inuocate and call vpon
the diuell, for to bring them out of that trouble (which is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_203" id="Page_ii_203">[203]</a></span>
thing commonly vsed amongest them, at all times when they
finde themselues in the like perplexitie); also they doo
request of him to showe them what they should doo to bring
themselues out of trouble.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_44" id="Footnote_1_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> Incorrectly written for "spoomed." To spoom a ship is to put her
right before the wind.</p></div>

<p>But when the Spaniards vnderstoode their dealinges, they
did disturbe them that they shoulde not perseuer in their
lottes and inuocations, and beganne to coniure the diuells,
which was the occasion that they would not answere vnto
the inuocation of the Chinos, who did call them after diuerse
manners (as hath been declared in the first part of this
historie); yet they heard a diuell say, that they should
not blame them because they did not answere vnto their
demaunde, for they could not doo it for that they were disturbed
by the coniuration of those Spanish fathers which
they carried with them in their shippe.</p>

<p>So presently, when the night was come, God was so
pleased that the storme ceased, and became, in fewe houres,
very calme, although it indured but a while; for, as they
beganne to set sayle to nauigate towardes the port, and
almost at the point to enter into the same, a new storme
seised on them, and with so great force, that they were constrayned
to returne vnto the sea, for feare to be broken in
pieces vpon the shore.</p>

<p>At this time they wanted both water and victualles, which
was vnto them a newe torment; and they were brought into
so great extremitie, that for ninetie and sixe persons that
were in the shippe, there was not left victuals for two
dayes.</p>

<p>The Chinos beganne a newe to inuocate the diuels by
writing, which is a way that they neuer let but doo answere
them, as they did at this instant, and were not disturbed by
the coniurations of the fathers; yet, notwithstanding they
lyed in their answere, for that they saide, that within three
dayes they should be within the citie of Manilla, and after
it was more then four dayes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_204" id="Page_ii_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>In conclusion, having by the fauour of Almightie God
ouercome all their trauayles by the sea, and the necessitie of
the lacke of water and victualles, they arriued at the desired
port the second day of Februarie, anno 1580; whereas they
were receiued by the gouernour, and of all the rest, with
great ioy, in pardoning them the offence they had committed
in going without licence, and shewed vnto them particular
fauours, and were very sorrowfull that the father Costodio
and his companions remained in Machao, for that hee was
wellbeloved of all, and that with great desert, for his vnderstanding,
learning, and holy life. Who, within fewe dayes
after, did write a letter vnto the rest of the religious men in
Manilla, aduertising them how that in a short time they
came vnto Machao in good health; and how that the
bishoppe and the captaine generall, with all the rest of the
towne, were verie glad and ioyfull of their comming, and
fully resolued to the contrarie of the false opinion that
they had conceiued of them, and that he was in great hope
to see his desire accomplished, for that he was daily in place
whereas they did see and comon with the Chinos, whom, so
soone as he can speake the language, he doth pretend to
instruct them in matters touching the faith. Also he
wrote, that he vnderstood by good originall or information
(although it was comitted in secret), that the kingdom or
province of Cochin China, which is four daies iourney from
Machao, whereas the Portingals hath contraction, and port
for all their ships that come from the Indias, hath sent vnto
the bishop of Machao, and doth demand of him priests for
to baptise them, with such determination and good will to
be Christians, that in some portes they haue alreadie timber
cut downe for to edifie churches. This you may belieue,
for that the bishop himselfe hath tolde him, and in the latter
end of his letter was written as followeth: They have
inuited me to this enterprise, and (for to put my selfe therein)
I would gladly haue with me many companions, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_205" id="Page_ii_205">[205]</a></span>
is the treasure that we go to seeke. It is a firme lande,
there whereas God hath prepared a great haruest. They
are politike people, and more easie to be conuerted then
the Chinos, for that the diuell hath not put so manie
disturbances against the gospel of Christ as in China,
although it doth ioyne vpon it; and once entering
the faith therein, with the fauour of God, their great and
difficult doings which now they haue among them, will be
broken with great ease; for they are not so many nor so
great, whereby wee should be discomforted to see them
ouercome, and principally they being men of so good wisedome
and vnderstanding, as we haue seene by experience in
the time that we haue beene amongest them; and so full of
mercie and pitie, that although wee entred into the lande
without licence, and for dooing of the same wee ranne in
great daunger of our owne liues, they did intreat vs well,
and gaue vs all that was needefull, and also did suffer vs to
preach, if we could the language; the which, with the
fauour of God, we will quickly learne, for that we are
whereas continually we doo common and talke with the
Chinos; wee doo verie earnestly commit it vnto our Lord to
direct and guide the same, that his holy name may bee
exalted, and the soules of these blinde Gentiles may knowe
and beleeue, and beleeuing, may be saued.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>"Of the reason of his Majesty's commanding these friars to proceed to the
kingdom of China; of their embarkation and arrival at the Canary
Islands.</i></p></div>

<p class="pmt2 smaller">"Our sovereign, King Philip, having been informed of the matters
relating to the great kingdom of China by certain friars of the order of
the blessed Doctor, S. Augustine, who came to his court; and having seen
the two accounts which they brought him from thence, of the entry of
the Augustine and Franciscan fathers (as may be seen more largely in
those accounts), and the letters of his governors of the Philippine
Islands, and of the provincials of the Orders, in which they begged him,
as has already been said in the first account, to send his embassy to the
sovereign of that great kingdom, with friars and ministers for the conversion
of the natives of the islands already discovered, and of the many
others which were being discovered every day; and that, by the king of
China giving opportunity for the preaching of the Gospel, they might
be enabled easily to succour and assist the Augustine fathers, who were
the first who entered those islands; his Majesty having sent forty friars
of the said order of Augustine, and many others of the order of the
blessed S. Francis: and moreover, the embassy (which they had begged
of him with so much earnestness), in order that there might be no want
of ministers, in the year eighty, he determined to send forty barefooted
friars of the province of S. Joseph, whose commissary was Miguel de
Talavera, with instructions and orders to proceed to New Spain, thence
to the Philippine Islands, and thence to the great kingdom of China, in
case there should be an opportunity of introducing the Holy Gospel.
According to the order of his Majesty, there were to have been fifty of
these friars; but from the prevalence of the plague of universal catarrh
in Spain, not more than thirty-four could be assembled. These then
were despatched and set forward by the order of the royal council of the
Indies, and of Monsignor Sega, the Apostolic Nuncio. And arriving at
Seville without the requisite licence to depart for the Indies, his Majesty's
commercial officers, who were about to despatch the fleet, would not
allow them to embark for want of the document; they had been told at
Madrid that it would be sent without fail. On account of this carelessness
they found themselves in a most unpleasant position; for the
fleet was departing, setting its sails, and leaving the bar of S. Lucar, and
they could not go in it for want of the licence; nor could they return
to their convents, because in Castile, whence they had come, they refused
to admit any one from Seville, which was infested by the plague. The
ships having got beyond the bar, there arose a sudden storm, in which
one of the largest vessels of the fleet was lost, and another had its main-yard
broken. The commander of the fleet, seeing that the damage
could not be remedied in a short time, sailed in three days, leaving the
ship which had its yard broken to refit, with orders to follow immediately.
During this time, his Majesty's licence for the passage of the friars
arrived at Seville, with an order to the officers that, at all events, they
were to be furnished and despatched with the greatest possible celerity.
This order arrived at 10 o'clock at night; and the friars were immediately
informed that they were to embark in the said ship, which was
ready to sail, having procured another yard. They appointed the day,
immediately following which was Sunday, at three o'clock in the morning,
and twenty-eight friars embarked, all preachers. God granted them
such favourable weather that they overtook, at the Canary islands, the
fleet which had sailed from S. Lucar some days before them. This
course was always southwest; and, although the distance is two hundred
and thirty leagues from S. Lucar to the islands, they reached them in
seven days. These islands are in nearly twenty-eight degrees latitude,
and are seven in number, all well provided with the necessaries of life:
there is much corn and wine, and various kinds of pulse, with abundance
of sugar, sheep, fowls, and camels, and all at much less prices
than in Spain. They are all inhabited by Spaniards, who live comfortably.
In one of them is a bishop, with prebendaries, a cathedral church,
and convents of friars. In short, there is but little difference between
these islands and Spain."</p>

<p>Saint Lucas de Barrameda, and the citie of Cadiz, from
whence ordinarily goeth foorth all such fleetes and shippes
that go vnto the occident, or West Indias, are distant the
one from the other onely fiue leagues, and in thirtie seuen

ten dayes. The seas are rough, which causeth great waues;
for which cause it is called the gulfe of the Jeguas.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote">Fortunadas.</span>
These ilands, which in ancient time were called Fortunadas,
are at this day called by the Spaniards the Canarias,
which is derived of <i>canes</i>, or dogs; for that there was in
them at such time as the Spaniardes did discouer them,
great quantitie of dogges, very bigge, fierce, and braue.
<span class="sidenote">The names of the Canarias.</span>
There are of them seuen ilands, which are called Gran
Canaria, Tenerife, Palma, Gomera, Yerro, Lancarote, and
Forte Ventura; and are in altitude twentie-eight degrees,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_210" id="Page_ii_210">[210]</a></span>
lacking very little, and haue in them many particular
thinges, of which I will declare some of them in briefe.</p>

<p>In the Iland of Tenerife, at the farther part thereof,
towards the northwest, there is a mountain called El Pico
de Tereyra, which, unto the iudgement of them who haue
seene it, is the highest in all the worlde, and is plainely
seene before you come to it three score leagues: so that a
ship going from Spaine vnto those ilandes, doth discouer
that mountaine first. None can ascende or go vp that
mountaine but in the moneths of July and August, for that
all other moneths of the yeare there is very much snow on
<span class="sidenote">Much snow.</span>
it, although in all those ilandes it doth neuer snowe, and to
mount the height thereof is three daies worke; on the top
of the same there is a round and plaine place, and being
thereon at such time as it is faire weather, and the seas
calme and in quiet, you may see all the seuen ilands, and
euerie one of them will seeme but a small thing in respect;
yet some of them are distant from that more than fiftie
leagues, and it hath as much more in compasse as that. In
the two monethes aforesaid, they do gather in the toppe
thereof all the brimstone that is brought from that iland
<span class="sidenote">Great quantitie of brimstone.</span>
vnto Spaine, which is much in quantitie. This mountaine
belongeth to the Duke of Maqueda, by particular gift of the
king.</p>

<p>In one of these seuen ilands aforesaid, called the Hierco,<a name="FNanchor_1_46" id="FNanchor_1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
there is a continuall woonder, which in my iudgement is one
of the greatest in all the worlde, and worthie to be knowen
amongest all men, whereby they may exalt the mightie
providence of God, and giue him thankes for the same.
This iland being the greatest amongest the seuen, is a
countrie very asper and vnfruitfull, and so drie that there
is no water to be found in all the iland, but on the sea side,
and that in fewe places, but very farre distant from the
inhabitance of the ilande. But there naturall necessitie is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_211" id="Page_ii_211">[211]</a></span>
remedied by the diuine prouidence of heaven (as aforesaide),
and by a strange meanes, which is, there is a great and
<span class="sidenote">The dropping from a tree doth

mightie tree (vnknowen, and the like hath not beene seene
in any part of the whole world), whose leaues are narrowe
and long, and are continually greene like iuie, vpon the
which tree is seene continually a small cloud, which neuer
augmenteth nor diminisheth, with the occasion that the
leaues continually, without ceasing, doth distill drops of
water, very cleere and fine, which doth fall into certaine
sesternes, which the inhabitantes of the townes haue made

following is a translation of what Leopold von Buch says of this
tree in his "Description Physique des Isles Canaries, traduite de l'Allemand,
par C. Boulanger." Par., 1836, 8vo., fo. 122.<br />
<br />
"There was formerly in the Island of Ferro a gigantic til (<i>Laurus
F&oelig;tens</i>), whose pulpy leaves extended their thick foliage to a great distance.
Every day, two or three hours after sunrise, the leaves of this
tree began to condense the water, which falling from leaf to leaf, like
drops of rain, collected together at the foot of the tree, in a very pure
stream. The inhabitants of the island, being altogether destitute of
spring water, used to go towards midday to draw this water, and return
to their homes in the evening with their pitchers full. The tree being
regarded as sacred passed for a wonder of the world: a keeper appointed
by the inhabitants had it in charge to collect the water in cisterns, and
presided at its distribution among all those who came to draw. This
remarkable tree was still existing in 1689, and was situated to the east,
above the little town of Valverde. Father Galindo, who saw it, has given
its description in detail. It survived long after that period; but its leaves
were diminished, and it lost its beneficent properties. Necessity compelled
the inhabitants to find some other means of supplying themselves
with water, and the tree was forgotten. Meanwhile, travellers going to
the new continent of America, never forget (whatever may be the number
or variety of objects that strike their imagination in those countries)
to speak of the tree of the Isle of Ferro. It has therefore preserved a
great reputation in Europe."</p>

<p>One hundreth leagues distant from these ilandes, towards
the right hand, there is an other thing of little lesse admiration
then the other that we haue spoken of, which is, that
many times there is seen an iland, which they cal S. Borandon.
Many being lost at the sea haue chaunced vpon the
same iland, and do say that it is a very fresh and gallant
iland, with great abundance of trees and sustinence, and
inhabited with Christian people, yet can they not say of
what nation or language. The Spaniards many times haue
gone with intent to seeke it, but neuer could finde it, which
<span class="sidenote">Opinions of this iland.</span>
is the occasion that there be diuers opinions touching the
same. Some doo say that it is an inchanted iland, and is
seene but certaine daies assigned or appointed: and others
say that there is no other let or impediment for the finding
therof, but because it is so little, and is continually couered
with great cloudes, and that there runneth from it riuers
which haue so great a current that it maketh it difficult to
come vnto it. My opinion is (if it be any thing worth) that
being true, that which so many haue spoken of this iland,
according vnto the common opinion which they haue in all
the seuen ilands of Canaria, it can not be without some great
mysterie: for he which can cause it to be all in a cloud, and
the swift current of the riuers to be an impediment to the
finding therof, can find remedie for the inhabitants to come
forth (if it be so for them that be without at the sea not to
go into it), yet can it not be for them within the iland, but
at some time there should haue some come foorth by chance,
and haue bin seene of some there abouts, and declared vnto
them the secret of that mysterie: from whence I do gather,
that either this iland is imagined or inchaunted, or else there
is in it other some great mysterie, for the which to giue
credite vnto it, or to varie from the truth, it shal be wisdome
not to proceed any further, but to conclude in that which
toucheth the Ilandes of Canarias aforesaid.<a name="FNanchor_1_48" id="FNanchor_1_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

There is gathered in them verie much wheate and other

that verie good. But in especiall camelles, whereof there is
great store. Also all kinde of sustenance is better cheape

<p>All these ilandes are inhabited with Spaniardes, whereas
they doo liue verie pleasantly, amongest whome, at this day,
there be some that be naturall of the Guanchas aforesaid,
who be verie much Spaniarde like. The principall of all
these seuen ilandes is the Gran Canaria, in the which is a
bishoppe and a cathedrall church, and counsell of the Inquisition

Domingo, otherwise called Hispaniola, and do declare of certaine

<p>After that the fleetes or shippes had taken refreshing in
the Ilandes of Canarias aforesayde, they departed from
thence, sayling by the same rutter, vntill they come vnto an
<span class="sidenote">The Iland called Desseado.</span>
ilande called the Desseado, which is fifteene degrees from
the Equinoctiall, eyght hundreth and thirtie leagues from
the Canarias: all which is sayled without seeing any other
land: they are sayling of the same ordinarily eight and twentie
and thirtie dayes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_214" id="Page_ii_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>This Iland Desseado was called by that name by reason
that the gulfe is great, and so many daies sayling, that when
they do see it, is that after that they haue verie much desired
the same, so that Desseado is as much to say, as "desired."
This iland hath nigh and about it many other ilandes, one of
<span class="sidenote">The Iland Dominica.</span>
the which is that which is called La Dominica, which is
peopled and inhabited by certaine Indians who are called
Caribes, by such as do nauigate that way, which are a kind
of people that doo eate humaine flesh: they are very expert
archers, and very cruell: they do anoint their arrowes with
a deadly earth, and so ful of poison, that the wound the
which is made therewith can not be healed by any humaine
remedie. This ilande is in fifteene degrees. It is verie
little and not of much people, yet notwithstanding it hath
beene the death of many Spaniardes both men and women:
such as haue come thither in shippes, not knowing the
daunger thereof, haue gone a shore for fresh water, or else
to wash their lynnen, and vppon a soddaine vnlooked for,
haue beene be set by the Indios, who haue slaine them, and
after eaten them: and they say that it is very sweete flesh
and sauorie, so that it be not of a fryer, for of fryers by no
meanes they will eate, nor would not after that happened
vnto them as hereafter followeth.</p>

<p>There was a ship that was bound vnto the firme land, and
did arriue at that ilande, in the which went two religious
fryers of the order of Saint Francis, and hauing no care as
aforesayde, but very desirous to be a lande, they went a
shore without any feare or suspition of any harme that might
happen vnto them; and being at a riuer side sporting themselues
with great recreation, by reason of the freshnesse
thereof, easing themselues of the long and painefull nauigation
which they had comming from the Ilandes of the Canarias
vnto that place, when the Caribes did see them, without
any feare, vpon a soddaine they descended from a mountayne,
and did kill them all, without leauing any person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_215" id="Page_ii_215">[215]</a></span>
aliue. Many dayes they made great feastes and bankets,
eating of those bodies which they had slaine, some sodde
and some roasted, as their pleasure was. So on a day they
would amongest them eate one of the fathers, who was very
<span class="sidenote">They which did eate friers flesh
did die madde.</span>
faire and white; but all that did eate of him in a little space
did swell marueilously, and did die madde, with great gaspings
that it was woonderfull to see: so that from that time,
they remaine as warned neuer for to eate any more of the
like flesh.</p>

<p>Of these euils they haue committed an infinite number,
and haue at this day with them many Spaniardes both men
and women, whose liues they pardoned for to serue their vses
or euilles, because they were verie young, of the which they
say that some haue fled away. They go naked like vnto the
Indians, and doo speake their language, and are almost conuerted
vnto their nature. This great inconuenience might
be remedied, if that it did please his maiestie to command
some generall that were bound vnto the firme land, or vnto
the New Spaine, to make abode there a fewe dayes, and to
roote out and make cleane that ilande of so euill and wicked
people, which were a good deede, and they doo well deserue
it, and to giue libertie vnto the poore Christians that are
there captiue, a great companie of them. And it is saide of
a truth that some of them be of good calling. There can
none goe a lande on this ilande, but straightwayes they are
discouered by such ordinarie spyes as they doo put to watch.
And if they do see that those which doo come a land are
many in number, and that they can not hurt them, they
doo remaine in the highest part of the mountayne, or else
amongest the thickest of woods and bushes, till such time as
the shippes do depart, which is so soone as they haue taken
fresh water or fire wood. They are great traytors, and when
they see oportunitie they giue the assalt, in the manner as
hath beene tolde you, and doo very much harme.</p>

<p>Nigh vnto this Ilande Dominica, towardes the northwest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_216" id="Page_ii_216">[216]</a></span>
is the Ilande of S. John de Puerto Rico, the which is in
eighteene degrees: it is fortie and sixe leagues long and
fiue and twentie leagues brode, and in compasse about an
hundred and fiftie leagues. There is in it great store of
<span class="sidenote">Much kine, sugar, and ginger: wheat and gold.</span>
kyne, verie much sugar and ginger, and yeeldeth very much
wheate. It is a lande of verie much golde, and is not laboured
nor taken out of the earth for lacke of people; it hath verie
good hauens and portes towardes the south, and towardes
the north onely one, the which is sure and good, in respect
whereof the Spaniardes did giue the name vnto the whole
ilande, Puerto Rico, taking the name of the port or hauen.
In it there is foure townes of Spaniardes, a bishoppe and a
cathedrall church, and he that is prelat at this day is the
reuerend father Don fryer Diego de Salamanca, of the order
of S. Austin.</p>

<p>When the Spaniardes went first vnto this ilande, according
vnto the report of the reuerende father de Las Casas, bishop
of Chiapa, was in the year 1509. This iland was so full of
trees and fruite that they gaue it the name of the Guertas;<a name="FNanchor_1_49" id="FNanchor_1_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Of the Iland of Santo Domingo, called Hispaniola, and of their
properties.</i></p></div>

<p>The Iland Hispaniola, which by an other name is called
<span class="sidenote">The Iland Hispaniola or Santo Domingo.</span>
Santo Domingo, by reason that it was discouered as that day, it
is in eighteene degrees, and was the first that way discouered
in the Indias, by the captaine Christopher Colon, worthie of
immortall memorie; it was inhabited in the yeare of 1492.
This iland is in compasse more than sixe hundredth leagues;
it is diuided into fiue kingdomes, the one of them is now
called the Vega, which, at the time that it was discouered
was called Neagua; it hath foure score leagues in compasse,
and stretcheth all of them from the north vnto the south; out
of the which sea, as doth testifie the reuerende of Ciapa in his
booke, doth enter onely into the kingdome, thirtie thousand
<span class="sidenote">Mightie riuers in Spain.</span>
riuers and running brookes, twelue of them as great as
Ebro, Duero, and Guadalquiuer in Spaine. The foresaide
bishop doth also speake of an other maruaile, which is, that
the most part of these riuers, those which do distil and run
from the mountaines, which is towardes the west, are very
rich of gold, and some of it very fine, as is that which is
taken out of the mynes of Cibao, which is very well knowen
in that kingdome, and also in Spaine, by reason of the great
<span class="sidenote">A peece of virgin gold so bigge as
a twopennie wheaten loaf.</span>
perfection thereof: out of the which myne hath been taken
out a piece of virgin golde, so bigge as a twopennie wheaten
loafe, and did weigh three thousand and sixe hundred
castillianos,<a name="FNanchor_1_50" id="FNanchor_1_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> the which was sonke and lost in the sea, in
carrying of it into Spaine, as doth testifie the aforesaid
reuerend bishop. In this Ilande there is greater quantitie
of cattell than in the other Ilande of Puerto Rico; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_218" id="Page_ii_218">[218]</a></span>
there is made much sugar, and gathered much ginger and
<span class="sidenote">Cannafistola.</span>
cannafistula, and also manie sortes of fruits, such as is in
Spaine, as others different of the countrie, and that in abundance:
there are also great store of hogs, whose fleshe is as
holesome and as sauorie as is mutton in Spaine, and is verie
good cheape: a heyfor is bought for eight ryalles of plate,
and all other thinges of that countrie after the rate, although
that the marchandice of Spaine is verie deere. It is a
<span class="sidenote">Gold and pearles.</span>
countrie of very much golde, if there were people for to take
it out: and manie pearles. In all this ilande they gather no
wheate, but in the bishopricke of Palensuela; although in
many other places the ground would yeeld it very well if
they would sowe it. But nature, which was woont to supplie
necessities, dooth accomplish the lacke of wheate to giue
them in steede thereof a roote, which dooth growe in that
iland in great quantitie and abundance, and dooth serve
<span class="sidenote">Bread of a roote called Casaue.</span>
them for bread, as it did vnto the naturall people of that
countrie, when the Spaniards went thither. It is white, and
is called casaue, the which being grinded and brought into
meale, they doo make bread thereof for their sustinence, the
which, although it is not so goode as that which is made of
wheat meale, yet may they passe therewith and sustaine
themselues.</p>

a weight for gold, is equivalent to 71 grains English.</p></div>

<p>This countrie is verie hoat, by reason whereof their
victuals are of small substance. The principall citie of that
iland is called Santo Domingo, (for the reason abouesaid), in
the which is an archbishop and a royall audience, or chaunoerie.
This citie is built on the sea side, and hath to it a
great riuer, the which dooth serue them for their port or
hauen, and is verie secure. There is in it three monasteries
of religious friers, and two of nunnes.</p>

<p>In this ilande (as saith the reuerende bishop of Chiapa in
<span class="sidenote">Of three millions of men not two
hundred left.</span>
his booke) there were, when as the Spaniards came first
thether, three millions of men naturall Indians, of the which
at this day there is not two hundred left, and yet the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_219" id="Page_ii_219">[219]</a></span>
part of them be sonnes vnto Spaniardes, and blacke mores
borne of the Indians women. All their sugar milles and
other places are inhabited with negros, of the which there
may be in that ilande about twelue thousand. It is a
holsome countrie vnto them that dwell therein. The sea is
ful of whales, and that in abundance, which are seene by
such as do come in their ships, and many times they are
in feare of them. But aboue all other, there is an infinite
<span class="sidenote">Tiburones.</span>
number of great fishes called tiburones,<a name="FNanchor_1_51" id="FNanchor_1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and are in great
skuls:<a name="FNanchor_2_52" id="FNanchor_2_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> they are marueilously affected vnto humaine flesh,
and wil folow a shippe fiue hundred leagues, without leauing
of it one day. Many times they haue taken of the fishes,
and do finde in their bellies all such filth as hath beene
throwne out of their shippe in many dayes sailing, and
whole sheepes heads with hornes and all. If they chance
to finde a man in the waters side he wil eat him all: if not,
all that he doth fasten on he doth sheare it cleane away, be
it a legge or an arme, or half his body, as many times it hath
beene seene, and they doo it very quickly, for that they
haue many rowes of teeth in their heads, which be as sharpe
as rasers.</p>

<span class="sidenote">The Iland of Iamayca.</span>
Jamayca, of fiftie leagues in longitude, and fourteene in

which are spowts of water, with many blustering winds.
This word <i>vracan</i>, in the Indian tongue of those ilands, is
as much to say, as the ioyning of all the foure principall
winds togither, the one forcing against the other: the which
ordinarily dooth blow vppon this coste, in the monethes of
August, September, and October, by reason whereof such
fleetes as are bound vnto the Indies doo procure to passe
that coast, before these three monethes or after, for that by
experience they haue lost many ships in those times. From
<span class="sidenote">The Iland of Cuba and the Port Hauana.</span>
this iland they go vnto the ilande of Cuba, which is in
twenty degrees, in the which is the port of Hauana, which
is called the Cape of San Anton: they doo put two hundreth

<p>When that any ships do go vnto Noua Espania, they haue
sight of them, and likewise when they doo returne: all
those which do come from the Peru do enter into the foresaid
port of the Hauana, which is a very good port and
sure, and there is to be had all kind of prouision necessary
and belonging vnto the fleetes and ships, some which the
ilande dooth yeeld it selfe, and other some brought from
other places: but in particular, there is great store of very
good timber, as wel for the repairing of ships as for other
thinges, with the which they do ordinarily balest their ships
that come for Spaine. The kinges maiesty hath in this a
gouernor and a captaine, with very good souldiers for the
defence thereof, and of a fort which is in the same harbor,
the best that is in all the ilands.</p>

<p>This iland of Cuba was discouered in the yeare 1511, and
was in it (being of the bignesse aforesaid) a great number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_221" id="Page_ii_221">[221]</a></span>
naturall people, and now but a very fewe: it hath a riuer
wherein is very much gold, according vnto the opinion of
the natural people, and was tolde by the fathers vnto their
children, the which was cast into that riuer by the natural
people, in this order following.</p>

<p>There was a casique, called Hatuey, who, for feare that
hee had of the Spaniards, came from the Iland Hispaniola,
vnto this iland with many of his people, and brought al
their riches, with much golde amongst them, who by the
relation of other Indians of Santo Domingo (wheras he had
been king), vnderstood that the Spanyardes were comming
vnto that iland, whereupon he gathered togither all his
people, and many of that iland, and made a parley vnto
them, saying: It is said of a certeintie, that the Christians
doo come into this iland, and you doo well vnderstand by
experience, what they haue done by the people of the kingdome
of Aytim (which was the Ilande Hispaniola), the like
will they doo here by vs; but do you know wherfore they
doo it? They answered and saide, because they were of their
owne nature cruel. The casique saide No, that they did it
<span class="sidenote">The Spaniards god is gold.</span>
not therefore; but because they had a God whom they did
worship, and because they will haue him from vs, they doo
kil vs: and in saying these words he tooke forth a basket
with golde and iewels which he brought thither in secret,
and shewed it vnto them saying, This is their God that I
spake off; let vs make vnto them areytos, the which are
sports and dances, and possible we shall please them, and
then wil they command their people not to do vs any harme.
For the accomplishing and furnishing of the same, euery one
of them brought that which they had in their houses, and
made therof a great mountaine of wheate, and danced
rounde about the same till they were werie: when the
<span class="sidenote">The Indians throwe all their gold
and iewels into the riuer.</span>
casique saide, I haue thought with myselfe whilst we were

with couetousnes to seek more from vs, we shall die; therefore
let vs throw it into this riuer. The which they did with
a common consent and good will.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Port of Saint Iohn de Lua.</span>
From this point or cape of Sant Anton, they saile to the
port of San Juan de Lua, which is on the firme land of
Mexico, two hundreth and thirtie leagues from the said
point: in all that bay there is great fishing, but in especial
of one kind of fish which is called <i>mero</i>, the which are so
easie to be taken, that in one day they may lade not
shippes but whole fleetes; and many times it happeneth that
they bring so many to their ships that they throw them
again into the sea for lack of salt to salt them with. They
<span class="sidenote">The Iland of Campeche.</span>
passe in sight of an iland, called Campeche, the which is a

people of that iland are conuerted unto the law of our Lord
Jesus Christ. There is in it a bishop and a cathedrall church,
a gouernor for his maiestie, and monasteries of friers. Within
few dayes after they depart from this ilande, and come
unto the port of Saint John de Lua, in the which, by reason
that it hath many flats, it is requisite to be carefull for to
enter into it: his maiestie hath in it a fort which is good and
<span class="sidenote">The citie of Vera Cruz.</span>
strong. Fiue leagues from this port is the cittie of the Vera
Cruz, whereas is the whole trade and traficke, and there is

that it is in the nineteene degrees, but well replenished of
all kinde of victuals: it was wont to be vnwholesome, but
now they say it is not so much; they know not what shoulde
bee the occasion, whether it bee by the moouings of the
heauens, or by the good gouernement and discretion of them
that do dwel in it. This cittie is from the citie of Mexico,
the which is metropolitan of al that kingdom, and by whom
al the rest is gouerned, seuentie leagues, al the way inhabited
and ful of townes, both of Indians, Spaniards, and so great

It is maruellous temperate, in such sort that almost throughout

sea: it is not possible to declare the bredth and length
thereof, for that vnto this day it is not all discouered.
Euery day they doo finde and discouer new countries, as in
the yeare of fourescore and three, you may perceiue by the
entry which was made by Antonio de Espeio, who, with his
companions, did discouer a countrie, in the which they found
fifteene prouinces, al ful of townes, which were full of houses
of foure and fiue stories high, the which they did name
<span class="sidenote">New Mexico.</span>
Nuevo Mexico, for that it doth resemble the Old Mexico in
many thinges. It is towards the north, and they do beleeue
that that way, by inhabited place, they may come vnto that
country which is called of the Labrador (of which shal be
spoken more at large hereafter).</p>

<p>This kingdome towards the orient dooth ioyne vnto the
<span class="sidenote">Peru.</span>
country of Peru, and so running by the north sea, and
<span class="sidenote">Nombre de Dios.</span>
reacheth vnto Nombre de Dios, which is a port of the saide
<span class="sidenote">Acapulco.</span>
kingdome, and from thence vnto Acapulco, which is a port
in the kingdome of Mexico: and in the south sea it reacheth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_224" id="Page_ii_224">[224]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Panama.</span>
vnto Panama, a port of the said Peru; and in the same sea
<span class="sidenote">The Straites of Magellanes.</span>
it extendeth nigh vnto the Straights of Magellanes, and not
farre from the river of Plata and Brasill.</p>

<p>To conclude, this kingdome is so great that vnto this day
they cannot find the end thereof: but euery day doth discouer
new countries, whereas all the Indians that they do
finde are verie easie to bee reduced vnto the Catholike faith,
for that they are people very docible, ingenious, and of a
good vnderstanding. There is amongst them diuers languages,
and verie different climes; although all generally
doo vnderstande the Mexican tongue, which is most common.
There are many prouinces inhabited by Indians and
Spaniards, that euery one of them is as bigge as a reasonable
kingdome; yet the greatest and most principall is that of
Mexico, whereas are many Indians and Spaniards, which
doo exceed all the rest in number: the names of them are
Honduras, Guatimala, Campeche, Chiapa, Guaiaca, Mechuacan,
Nueua Galicia, Nueua Viscaya, Guadiana, and
others more, which I leaue out because I woulde not be
tedious: in all the which, they haue either a royall audience
and gouernors, or other justices, all Spaniards.</p>

<p>The naturall people whereof, neuer since they were conuerted
haue beene found in any heresie, nor in any thing
contrarie vnto the Romish faith. All these prouinces
are subject and doo acknowledge that of Mexico as the
principall: there whereas his maiestie hath his vizroy, an
inquisition, an archbishop, and a royall audience or court of
Chancerie.</p>

<p>This cittie of Mexico is one of the best that is in all the
whole world, and is situated vpon water after the manner
and fashion of Venice in Italie: in all this kingdome almost
you cannot know when it is winter, or when it is summer,
for that in al the whole yeare, there is smal difference
betwixt the daies and the nights, by reason of the temperature
of the countrie; the fieldes are greene almost all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_225" id="Page_ii_225">[225]</a></span>
whole yeare, and trees beare fruit also almost all the whole
yeare: for when it is winter in Europa, then doo there
fall dewes from heauen which dooth cause all things to
budde and floure; and in the summer it doth ordinarily
<span class="sidenote">It rayneth almost euery day.</span>
raine, but especially in the monethes of June, July, August,
and September, in the which monethes it is a maruel when
it raineth not euery day; and it is to bee wondred at, for
that almost it neuer rayneth but from noone forwards, and
neuer passeth midnight, so that it neuer troubleth them that
doo trauell by the way, for that they may beginne their
iourney at midnight, and trauell vntill the next day at noone.
It raineth vnreasonably, and with so great furie and force,
that the time that it dooth indure, it is requisite to flie from
the showers; for that many times they are so hurtfull, that
one sole shower taketh away the life of a man.</p>

<p>Almost all the whole yeare in this kingdome they do sowe
and gather as wel wheate (wherof they haue great abundance)
as maiz, which is the ordinary sustentation of al the
Indians, blacke moores and horse, of the which they haue
<span class="sidenote">The best horses in all the world.</span>
great abundance very gallant and good, both to the eye, and
indeed, as in any kingdom in al the whole world that is
knowne vnto this day. The brood of them was carried out
of Spaine thither, when first they did discouer that country,
and for that effect were chosen the best that could bee found:
and for that they doo eate all the whole yeare greene grasse
and maiz, which is wheat of the Indians, is the occasion that
they do deserue to haue the praise aboue all other. In fine,
this kingdome is one of the fertilest of victuals of al that ever
we haue heard off, and of riches, for that there is in it an
<span class="sidenote">An infinite number of siluer mines.</span>
infinite number of siluer mines, out of the which is taken
great abundance, as it is to be seene euery yeare when as the
shippes doo come vnto Syuell. It is vnder the Torrida Zona,
yet notwithstanding it is of the temperature as I haue said,
contrarie vnto the opinion of ancient philosophers, who said
that it was not inhabited. But now to excuse them, it shal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_226" id="Page_ii_226">[226]</a></span>
not be from our purpose to declare the cause wherefore they
were deceiued, and is, that in the foure monethes aforesaide,
wherein the sunne hath his most force, it doth continually
rayne, which is the occasion that the country is so temperate:
and besides this, God doth prouide that it is visited
with fresh windes, which come both out from the South and
North Sea, and is so ordinarie a thing, that it is a maruell to
see it calme, by reason whereof the whole kingdome is of
that propertie; and although the sunne be very strong and
causeth great heate, yet putting himselfe vnder any shadowe,
although it bee but little, they straightwayes feele a fresh
and comfortable winde, by reason of the temperature of the
heauen in the manner aforesaid.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this kingdome throughout al the whole
yeare, neede not to augment nor diminish their apparell,
neither their beddes. Also the aire and clime is so holesome,
that you may lie and sleepe in the fieldes without any
thing vppon you, as in any house, be it neuer so well hanged
and close.</p>

<p>All that is discouered of this kingdome (except it be the
lande of the Chichimecos, which is a kind of Indians that
liueth as the Alarbes<a name="FNanchor_1_55" id="FNanchor_1_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> do in Africa, without any house or
towne)&mdash;all the rest, I say, are in peace and quietnes baptised
and doctrined, and furnished with many monasteries
of diuers orders of religious men, as of the order of
S. Dominicke, of S. Francis, of S. Austen, and of Iesuits,
besides a great number of priests that are reparted in al
parts of that kingdome, so that the one and the other are
continually occupied in doctrining of the naturall people
and other Spaniards that are in that kingdome, of whome,
although they be but a few in respect of the Indians, yet do
they surmount in number more then fiftie thousand. In the
principall citie of this kingdome, which is that of Mexico as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_227" id="Page_ii_227">[227]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">An universitie in Mexico.</span>
aforesaid, there is a vniuersitie, and in it be many schooles,
whereas is red any facultie, as is in Salamanca, and that by
men of great sufficiencie, whose trauell is gratified with great
rentes and honor. There bee also in it many great hospitals
as well of Spaniards as of Indians, wheras the sicke men are
cured with great charitie and comfort, for that euery one of
them haue great rents and reuenues. I do not intreat of the
churches and monasteries, both of friers and nunnes, which
are in that cittie, nor of other particular thinges, for that
thereof there is written a large historie, and my intent is to
declare by way of a comentary that which the said father
Costodio and frier Martin Ignacio did comon with me by
word of mouth, and that I saw written and vnderstood of
him at his returne from trauelling almost the whole world,
and of other things that I my selfe haue experimented in
certaine parts of it: so that this my discourse may more properly
be called an epitome or itinerario then a historie. In
this kingdome there are bred and brought vp more cattell
then in any other parts knowne in all the world, as wel for
the good climate and temperature of the heauen, as also for
the fertility of the country. The kine and sheepe many times
bring foorth twise a yeare, and the goates ordinarily thrise a
yeare: so that because they haue many fields in that countrie,
and much people that doo giue themselues vnto that
kinde of gettings (as grasiers) is the occasion that there is so
great abundance, and solde for a small price; and manie
times it happeneth that the bringers vp of them doo kill
tenne thousand head of them onely to profite themselues with
the skinnes, in sending of them into Spaine, and leaue the
flesh in the fieldes to feede the foules of the ayre, without
making any more account thereof.</p>

Spanish.</p></div>

<p>There is great aboundance of many sorts of fruites, some
of them very different from those which are gathered in
our Europa, and the most part of them: but amongst all
notable things which are to be considered off in that kingdome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_228" id="Page_ii_228">[228]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">A strange kind of tree.</span>
(which are manie), one of them is a plant called
maguay, and an ordinarie thing in all those prouinces and
townes, of the which they make so many things for the seruice
and vtilitie of them that do dwel therin, that it is hard
to be beleeued of them that haue not seene it (although in
al places you haue many witnesses to it). They take out of
this plant wine, which is that which the Indians doo drinke
ordinarily, and the negros: also excellent good vinegar,
honie, a kinde of thride or yarne, wherewith they doo make
mantels to apparel the naturals, and for to sow the same apparell:
the leafe haue certaine pricks whereof they do make
needels wherewith they sow their apparel, their shooes, and
slippers. The leaues of that plaint, ouer and aboue that
they are medicinal, they do serue to couer there in the place
of tyles, and being dipped in the water, they make thereof
a certaine thing like hempe which serueth for many thinges,
and make thereof repaue; and the trunke of this plant is so
bigge and strong, that it serueth for ioystes and beames
whereon they doo build their houses, which commonly is
couered with strawe, or else with brode leaues of trees, as is
that of this plant.<a name="FNanchor_1_56" id="FNanchor_1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> All this, although it seemeth much, yet
in respect it is nothing considering the great profite that is
made of this plant: as shalbe declared vnto you when we

great aboundance of them, as I refer it vnto the iudgment of

<p><span class="sidenote">Properties of the Indians.</span>
The Indians of this kingdome are maruellous ingenious,
and doo see nothing but they imitate the same, whereof
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_229" id="Page_ii_229">[229]</a></span>
commeth that they are very good singers and plaiers vpon
all sorts of instruments, yet their voices doo heale<a name="FNanchor_1_57" id="FNanchor_1_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> them
nothing. They are very much affectioned vnto matters
touching ceremonies of the Church, and giuen vnto the
diuine culto, and therein they doo very much exceede the
Spaniardes. In euery towne there are singers appointed,
which repaire euery day vnto the church to celebrate the
offices vnto our Lady, the which they do with great consort
and deuotion. Touching the dressing and adorning of a
church with flowers and other curiosities, they are maruellous
politike: they are reasonable good painters in some
places: they make images of the feathers of small birdes,
which they call in their language Cinsones,<a name="FNanchor_2_58" id="FNanchor_2_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which haue no
feete, and feede of nothing else but of the dewe that falleth
from heauen, and is a thing greatly to be seene, and was
wont in Spaine to cause great admiration; but in especiall
vnto such as were famous painters, to see with what curiositie
<span class="sidenote">Pictures made of fethers.</span>
and subtiltie they did make their pictures, in applying
euery colour of the feathers in his place. They are people
of great charitie, but in especiall vnto the ecclesiasticals,
which is the occasion that one of them may trauell from sea
to sea (which is more then fiue hundred leagues) without
the spending of one riall of plate in victuals, or in any other
thing, for that the naturals doo giue it them with great good
will and affection: for the which in all their common places
of resort, which is an inne for strangers, they haue men
appointed for to prouide for all ecclesiasticall men that doo
trauel, of all that they haue neede, and likewise vnto the
common people, for their money. They doo not onely receiue
great content with them, but they themselues doo go
and request them to come vnto their townes, at the entrie
whereof they make them great entertainement: they go all
foorth of the towne both small and great in procession, and
manie times more than halfe a league, with the sounde of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_230" id="Page_ii_230">[230]</a></span>
trumpets, flutes, and hoybuckes. The principallest amongst
them go forth with bowes and nosegayes in their hands, of
the which they doo make a present vnto such religious as
they doo receiue: and sometimes they cast them more
flowers then they woulde willingly they shoulde. Generally,
they doo reuerence all ecclesiasticals, but in particular those
of such religious houses, which in that kingdome were the
first that did conuert them and baptise them; and they do it
in such sort, that if the religious man will for any offence
punish or whippe any of them, they do it with such facilitie,
as a master of a schoole doth beate his schollers that he doth
learne.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hernando Cortes.</span>
This great reuerence and subjection was planted amongst
them by the worthy captaine Hernando Cortes, marques Del
Valle, hee who in the name of the Emperor Charles the fift
of famous memorie, did get and made conquest of that
mightie kingdome. He who amongst other vertues that be
spoken of him (and doo indure vnto this day in the memory
of the naturall people of that countrie, and as I do beleeue
his soule is mounted many degrees in glory for the same),
hee had one that surmounted the other in excellency, which
was, that he had great reuerence and respect vnto priestes,
but in especial vnto religious men, and his will was that the
same should bee vsed amongst the Indians: at all times
when hee did talke with any religious person, he did it with
so great humilitie and respect, as the seruant vnto his master.
If he did at any time meete with any of them in the streete,
he being on foote, a good space before hee came vnto them,
hee woulde put off his cappe, and when hee came vnto them
he would kisse their handes: and if hee were on horsebacke,
he had the like prevention, and woulde alight and doo the
like. By whose example, the naturall people of that countrie
doo remains with the same custome, and is obserued and
kept in all that countrie vnto this day, and with so great devotion,
that in what towne so euer that any ecclesiasticall or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_231" id="Page_ii_231">[231]</a></span>
religious man doth enter, the first that doth see them before
they enter therein, doo runne vnto the church and ring the
bell, which is a token knowne amongst them all that a religious
man is comming, so that foorthwith all the women go
foorth in the streete whereas they do passe, with their children
in their armes, and bringe them before the religious
men, that they should blesse them, although he be on horseback,
and do passe a long thorow the towne.</p>

<p>In all this countrie there is great aboundance of victuals
and fruit, that the mony being of so small estimation (by
reason they haue so much), a ryall of plate is no more woorth
there then a quartillo in Spain: you shall buy there a verie
faire heafor for twelue rials of plate, and fiftie thousand if
you will at the same price, and a calfe for sixe or eight rials
of plate, a whole sheepe for foure rials, and two hennes, such
as you haue in Spaine for one riall, and of Guiny hennes,
otherwise called Turkey cockes,<a name="FNanchor_1_59" id="FNanchor_1_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and in Spanish Pavos, you
shall haue an hundred thousande (if you please) for a riall
and a halfe of plate a peece, and after this rate all other
sortes of victuals whatsoeuer you will buy, although they be
neuer so good: wine and oyl is very deare, for that it is
brought out of Spaine, not for that the countrie will not
yeeld thereof, and that in great aboundance (as hath beene
seene by experience), but they wil not consent to it for
<span class="sidenote">Medicinall hearbes.</span>
diuers respectes. There be thorough out all the whole kingdome
many hearbes that are medicinall, and the Indians very
much experimented in them, and do always cure with them,
in such sort that almost there is no infirmitie but they haue
a remedy for the same, and do minister it, by reason whereof
they do liue very healthfull, and do die verie seldome, but of
leanenes, or when the radicall moistnesse is consumed.
<span class="sidenote">They vse no compounds.</span>
They vse little lettings of bloode, and lesse of compounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_232" id="Page_ii_232">[232]</a></span>
purgations, for that they haue amongst them other simples
which they bring out of the fielde, wherewith they do
euacuate their humors, applying them vnto the pacient.
They bee for little trauell, and doo passe with little meate,
and verie seldome sleepe but on a matte vpon the ground,
but the most part in the fields in the open aire, which as wee
haue saide hurteth not, neither themselues nor yet the
Spaniards.</p>

expression in Spanish is, "hens from the Indies, which in Spain are

<p>But now to speake in few words that which requireth
a great discourse and many words, and yet notwithstanding
not expresse well that which might be said of this mightie
kingdome: I will conclude in comparing it vnto the most
greatest and richest of all that is now knowne in all the
world, except that of China, of the which in this historie
hath beene mentioned so many thinges, and shall be more
spoken off, when as we shall come to intreate of it; for that

<p>In the said chapter I said that in the yeare 1583 there
was discouered fifteene prouinces, the which the discouerers
<span class="sidenote">New Mexico.</span>
therof doo call the New Mexico, vppon the firme lande of
Nueua Espania, and I did promise to giue notice of the
discouering thereof, the which I will do with as much
breuitie as is possible, for that if I shoulde difusely declare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_233" id="Page_ii_233">[233]</a></span>
all that they did see and knowe, it were requisite to make of
it a newe historie: the substance thereof is, that in the yeare
of our Lord 1581, hauing notice there of a religious man, of
the order of Saint Francis, who was called frier Austen Ruyz,
who dwelt in the valley of Saint Bartholomew, by the relation
of certaine Indians called Conchos, who did communicate
with others their neighbors called Pasaguates, who said
that towards the parts of the north (trauelling continually by
lande) there were certaine ilandes very great, and neuer
knowne nor discouered by the Spaniards, who being
moved with great zeale of charitie for the saluation of those
soules, did aske licence of the Counte of Corunnia, vizroy of
the saide Nueua Espania, and of his owne superiors for to
go togither, and to procure to learne their language: and
knowing it necessarie to baptise and preach vnto them the
holie evangelist, hauing obtained the licence of the aforesaide
persons, taking with him other two companions of the
same order, with eight other souldiers, who of their owne
good wil would beare them company, he departed to put in
execution his Christian zeale and intent: who after a few
dayes that they had trauelled, they came into a prouince
<span class="sidenote">The prouince of Tiguas</span>
which was called the Tiguas, distant from the mines of Saint
Bartholomew (from whence they began their iourney) two
hundred and fiftie leagues towardes the north, in the which
by a certaine occasion the naturall people thereof did kill
one of the friers companions: who, as also the souldiers that
went with him, seeing and perceiuing the successe,<a name="FNanchor_1_61" id="FNanchor_1_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and likewise
fearing that thereof might happen some other greater
danger, they determined with a common consent to returne
vnto the mines from whence they departed, with consideration
that the company which went with him were very fewe
to make resistance against such successes as might happen,
being so farre distant from the dwellings of the Spaniards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_234" id="Page_ii_234">[234]</a></span>
and from their necessarie succour. The two religious men
which remained did not onely refuse their determination,
but rather seeing good occasion to put their good desire in
execution, and so much ripe mies<a name="FNanchor_2_62" id="FNanchor_2_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> or dainties for the Lordes
table, and seeing they could not perswade the souldiers to
proceed forwards in the discouering thereof: they alone remained
in the saide prouince with their Indian boyes, and
a Mestizo that they carried with them, thinking that although
they did remaine alone, yet were they there in securitie,
by reason of the great affabilitie and loue wherewith
the naturall people did intreat them.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_61" id="Footnote_1_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> This word is evidently coined from the Spanish word "suceso", an
event or occurrence. It is used in the same sense a few lines further on.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_62" id="Footnote_2_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> We do not find this word. The literal translation is, "so great a
harvest ripe and ready to offer at the table of God."</p></div>

<p>So when the eight souldiers came vnto the place that
they desired, they straightwayes sent the newes of al that
happened vnto the cittie of Mexico, vnto the vizroy, which
is distant from the mines of Saint Barbora one hundred and
three score leagues. But the friers of S. Francis were very
much agreeued for the remaining there of their brethren,
and fearing least they should be slaine, for that they were
there alone, they began to moue the hearts and minds of
other souldiers, that were in the company of another religious
frier of that order, called Frier Bernardino Beltran, for to
returne to the said prouince, to deliuer the aforesaide two
religious men out of danger, and from thence to prosecute
and go forwards with their enterprise begun.</p>

<p>At this time there were at the said mines by a certaine
occasion, an inhabitant of the cittie of Mexico, called Antonio
de Espeio, a very rich man, of great courage and
industrie, and verie zealous in the seruice of the maiestie of
King Philip: hee was naturally borne of Cordoua, who,
when that he vnderstood the great desire of the saide friers,
and howe much it did import, did offer himselfe to go on
that iournay, and to spend thereon part of his substance,
besides the venturing of his life. So licence being granted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_235" id="Page_ii_235">[235]</a></span>
vnto him to prosecute the same, by some that did represent
the king's person, and was procured by the saide friers,
there was appointed and giuen him for captaine, John de
Ontiueros (who was chiefe bayley for his maiestie, in the
townes which are called the foure Cienegas, which are in the
gouernement of the new Biscay, seuenty leagues from the
aforesaid mines of S. Barbora), and he to go with him, and
gather togither men and souldiers, such as he could, for to
accompany him, and helpe to follow their Christian intent.</p>

<p>The saide Antonio de Espeio was so earnest in this matter,
that in a few dayes he had ioyned togither souldiers, and
made prouision necessarie for the iourney; and spent therein
a great part of his substance, and departed altogether from
the valley of Saint Bartholomew the tenth of Nouember,
1582, and carry with him (for whatsoeuer should happen)
one hundred and fifteene horses and mules, great stoare of
weapons and munition, with victuals, and certaine people of
seruice in this iourney necessarie. He directed his iourney
towards the north; and at two dayes iourney they came
whereas were a great companie of Indians, of those which
<span class="sidenote">The prouince of Conchos.</span>
he called Conchos: they were in raches<a name="FNanchor_1_63" id="FNanchor_1_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and in houses made
of straw, who, when they vnderstoode of their comming, by
relation of long time before, they went forth and entertained
them with shewes of great ioy. The feeding of these people,
and of al the rest of that prouince, the which is great, is of
<span class="sidenote">Great store of conies, hares, and venison.</span>
conyes flesh, hares, and venison, of the which they haue
great aboundance. They have great store of maiz, which is
wheat of the Indians, pompines and mellons, very good and
in aboundance. They haue many riuers full of fish, very
good and of diuers sorts: they go almost al naked; and the
weapons that they doo vse are bowes and arrowes; and liue
vnder the gouernement and lordship of caciques as they of
Mexico: they found no idols amongst them, neither could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_236" id="Page_ii_236">[236]</a></span>
they vnderstande that they did worship any thing; for the
which they did easilie consent that the Spaniards should set
vp crosses, and were very well content therewith, after that
they were informed by the Spaniards the signification thereof;
the which was done by interpreters that they carried
with them, and by whose meanes they vnderstood of other
inhabitances, whether as the said Conchos did conduct them,
and did beare them company more then foure and twenty
leagues; all which way was inhabited with people of their
owne nation: and in al places whereas they came, they were
receiued with peace, by aduice that was giuen by the
caciques from one towne to another. So hauing passed the
foure and twenty leagues aforesaide, they came vnto another
<span class="sidenote">Passaguates.</span>
nation of Indians called Passaguates, who liue after the
manner and fashion of the other aforesaid Conchos, their
borderers, who did vnto them as the others did, conducting
them forwarde other foure dayes iourney, with aduice of the
caciques as afore. The Spaniards found in this iourney
<span class="sidenote">Mines of siluer.</span>
many mines of siluer (according to the iudgement of them
that vnderstand that faculty), and of very rich mettall.
One iourney from this they came to another nation called
<span class="sidenote">Tobosos.</span>
the Tobosos, who, when they discouered the Spaniards,
they fled vnto the mountaines, and left their townes and
houses void: but more after they vnderstood that, certain
yeares past, there came vnto that place certaine souldiers for
to seeke mines, and carried with them captiue certaine of
the natural people of that country, for which occasion they
remaine as scared and feareful. The captain forthwith gaue
order, that they should be called backe again, with assurance
that there should be no hurt done to them; and did so much
that many of them returned, of whom they made much on,
and gaue them giftes, declaring vnto them by the interpreter,
that they came not thither to do hurt to any; with the
which they all returned and were in quiet, and consented
that they should set vp crosses, and declare the mysterie of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_237" id="Page_ii_237">[237]</a></span>
them, and they made shew that they were content therewith;
and did accompany them, as the other their borderers did,
vntil they had brought them into the inhabitance of another
different nation, which was distant from them twelue leagues.
They vse bowes and arrowes, and do go naked.</p>

<p>The nation that the saide Tobosos did conduct them to is
<span class="sidenote">Iumanos.</span>
called Jumanos, who, by another name are called by the
Spaniards, Patara Bueyes; their prouince is very [large] and
full of townes, with much people: their houses made of lime and
stone, and their townes traced in very good order: al the
men and women haue their faces raced,<a name="FNanchor_1_64" id="FNanchor_1_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and their legs and
armes: they are corpulent people, and more decent then
any that they had seene vntil that time: they haue great
store of prouision, and hunt both of beasts and foules; great
store of fish, by reason of mightie riuers that commeth from
the north, and some of them as big as Guadalquiuer, the
which doth enter into the North sea: they haue many lakes
of salt water which, in certaine times of the yeare, do
<span class="sidenote">Good salt.</span>
congeale, and they do make thereof good salt. They are
warlike people, and made shew thereof presently; for the
first night that the Spaniards had placed themselues, with
their arrowes they slew fiue horse, and hurt as many more,
and would haue left not one aliue if they had not been
defended by the guarde. When they had done this mischiefe,
they left the town, and went to a mountain which
was hard by; whether as presently in the morning went
their captaine with other fiue souldiers, well armed, with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_238" id="Page_ii_238">[238]</a></span>
interpreter called Peter, a naturall Indian borne, and with
faire words and perswasions he quieted them and made
peace, and caused them to descend into their towne and
houses; and perswaded them to giue aduice vnto their
neighbours, that they were men that would hurt no bodie,
neither came they thither to take away their goods; the
which he obtained easely by wisedome, and in giuing vnto
the caciques certaine glasse beades and hartes<a name="FNanchor_2_65" id="FNanchor_2_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> which they
carryed for that purpose, and other trifles: so with this, and
with the good intretement done vnto them, there went many
of them in the company of the Spaniardes many dayes,
alwayes trauelling alongst the riuer side aforesayde, whereas
were many townes of Indians of this nation, the which
indured twelue dayes iourney: in all the which, the caciques
gaue aduice from one towne to another, out of the which
they came forth and entertained the Spaniards without their
bowes and arrowes, and brought with them victuals and
other prouision and giftes; but in especiall hides and shamway
skins, very well dressed, so that those of Flanders do
nothing exceed them. These people are all clothed; and they
found that they had some light of the holy faith, for that they
made signe vnto God, looking vp vnto heauen, and they do cal
him in their language <i>Apalito</i>, and doo acknowledge him for
Lord, by whose mightie hand and mercie they confesse to
haue receiued life, and to be a natural man, and al temporall
goods. There came many of them with their wiues and
children to the religious frier (that came with the captaine
and souldiers, of whom we haue spoken off), for to crosse
and blesse them; of whom being demanded, from whence
and of whom they had the knowledge of God: they answered,
that of three Christians and one negro that passed
that way, and remained there certain daies amongst them,
who, according to the signes and tokens they gaue them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_239" id="Page_ii_239">[239]</a></span>
should be Aluar Nunnez Cabesa de Vaca and Dorantes, and
Castillo Maldonado, and one negro, the which escaped out
of the fleete wherewith Panfilo de Naruaz entred into Florida;
and after that they had bin many dayes captiue and
slaues, they escaped and came vnto these townes, whereas
God by them did shew many myracles in healing (by the
onely touching with their handes) many diseases and sicke
persons, by reason thereof they left great fame in all that
countrie. All this prouince remained in peace and quietnesse;
by which demonstration they did accompanie and
served the Spaniardes certaine dayes, trauelling alongest the
riuer side aforesaide.</p>

<p>Within few dayes after they came vnto a great inhabitation
of Indians, where they came foorth to receiue them, by
newes that they had of their neighbours, and brought with
them many curious thinges made of feathers of different
colours, and many mantles made of cotton, barred with
blewe and white, like vnto them that are brought from
China to truck for other thinges. All of them, as well the
men as women and children, were clothed with shamway
skins, very good and well dressed; yet could the Spaniardes
neuer vnderstande what nation they were, for lacke of an
interpreter that vnderstood their language. They dealt
with them by signes; and they shewed vnto them certaine
stones of rich metall, and being demaunded if they had of
the same in their countrie: they answered by the same
signes, That fiue dayes iourney from thence, towardes the
northwest, there was great quantitie thereof; and howe that
they would conduct them thither and showe it vnto them,
as afterwardes they did performe, and did beare them companie
two and twentie leagues, the which was all inhabited
with people of the same countrie.</p>

<p>So following the saide riuer they came vnto an other
inhabitance of much more people than the other past, of
whom they were well receiued, and welcomed with many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_240" id="Page_ii_240">[240]</a></span>
presents, especially of fish; for that they haue great store
by reason of certaine great lakes not farre from thence,
wherin is bred great abundance. They were amongest
these people three dayes; in the which, both day and night,
they made before them many dances, according vnto their
fashion, with a particular signification of great ioy. They
knew not how this nation was called, for lacke of an interpreter:
but yet they vnderstoode that it extended very farre
and was very great. Amongest this nation they found an
Indian, a Concho by nation, who tolde and made signes that
fifteen iourneys from thence, towardes the northwest, there
was a lake which was verie broad, and nigh vnto it very
great townes, and in them, houses of three and four stories
high; the people well apparelled, and the countrie full of
victuals and prouision, who did offer himselfe to bring them
thether; whereat the Spaniards reioyced, but left to giue
the enterprise, only for that they would accomplish their
intent and begon voiage, which was to go to the north to
giue ayde vnto the two religious men aforesaide. The
chief and principall thing that they noted in this prouince
was, that it was of a good temperature, and a rich countrie,
great store of hunt, both of foot and wing, many rich metals,
and other particular thinges of profite.</p>

<p>From this prouince they folowed their iourney for the
space of fifteene daies without meeting any people: they
trauelled amongst high and mightie pine trees, like those of
Spaine; at the end wherof, after they had traueiled to their
iudgments four score leagues, they came vnto a small village
of very few people, very poore, and their houses made of
strawe: they had great quantity of deere-skins, as well
dressed as those that are brought out of Flanders; great
store of excellent white and good salt. They gaue them
good intertainment for the space of two daies that they
remained there; after the which they did beare them companie
twelue leagues, vnto certaine great habitations, always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_241" id="Page_ii_241">[241]</a></span>
trauelling alongst the riuer side towarde the north, as aforesaide,
till such time as they came vnto the countrie which is
called the New Mexico. All alongst this riuer side was
planted full of white salow trees;<a name="FNanchor_1_66" id="FNanchor_1_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and in some place it was
foure leagues brode. Likewise there was many walnut-trees
and peare-trees, like vnto those in Spaine.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_66" id="Footnote_1_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> Willows.</p></div>

<p>In the ende of two dayes trauaile amongest these trees,
they came vnto tenne townes, the which were situated
alongst this riuer side on both partes, besides others that
appeared, but farther distant. It seemed vnto them to haue
much people, and as appeared to be more than tenne
thousande soules.</p>

<p>In this prouince they did receiue them courteously, and
carried them vnto their townes, whereas they gaue them
great store of prouision and hennes of the countrie, with
many other things, and that with a great good will. In
these townes were houses of foure stories high, verie well
<span class="sidenote">Houses of 4 stories high.</span>
wrought and gallant chambers, and most of them had steuues
or hote houses for the winter. They are all apparelled with
cotton and of deares skinnes; the manner and apparell both
of the men and of the women, is much like vnto the Indians
of the kingdome of Mexico. But that which did cause them
most for to woonder was, to see both men and women to
weare both bootes and shooes of very good lether, with three
sooles of neates leather: a thing which they haue not seene
but onely there. The women go without any thing vpon
their heades; but their haire trimly kembed and dressed.
Euerie one of these townes had caciques, by whom they
were gouerned, as amongest the Indians in Mexico, with sergeantes
and officers to execute their commandement, who
goe through the streetes of the towne, and declare with a
loude voice the will of the caciques, the which is straightwayes
put in vre.</p>

<p>In this prouince the Spaniardes founde many idolles that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_242" id="Page_ii_242">[242]</a></span>
they worshipped; and in euery house they had a temple
<span class="sidenote">They worship the diuell.</span>
wherein they do worship the diuell, whereas, ordinarily,
they do carrie him to eat. Likewise, as amongst Christians,
in the high wayes they doo put crosses; so have they
chappelles, whereas they say, the diuell doth recreate and
rest himselfe, when as he trauelleth from one towne to another;
the which chappelles are maruellously well trimmed
and painted.</p>

<p>In all their tyllages and ploughed groundes, of the which
they haue many and very great, they haue on the one side
of them, a portall or shedde built vppon foure pillers,
whereas the labourers do eate and passe away the heate of
the day, and are people verie much giuen to labour, and doo
continually occupie themselues therein: it is a countrie full
of mountaynes and woods of pine trees. Their weapons are
strong bowes and arrowes, with their heads or pointes made
of flint stone, wherewith they will pierce and passe a shirt
of mayle or plate coate. They vse also macans, the which
is a staffe of half a yeard long, made of flint, and verie
smoth, wherewith they may cut a man a sunder in the midst;
they vse also bucklers and targets made of rawe hides.</p>

<p>So after they had beene four dayes in this prouince, they
departed; and, not farre distant from the same, they came
vnto another, which was called the prouince of the Tiguas,
in the which they found sixteene townes; in the one of the
same, called Poala, they vnderstood that the Indians had
slaine the two friars, Francisco Lopez and Frier Augustine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_243" id="Page_ii_243">[243]</a></span>
whome they went to seeke: and with them, three boyes and
a Mestizo. But when they of this towne and their neighbours
vnderstoode, being pricked in conscience, and fearing
that the Spaniards came to plague them, and to be reuenged
for the death of the saide fathers, they durst not abide, but
left their houses voide and fled vnto the mountaines that
were nighest hande, from whence they could neuer cause
them to descende, neither by giftes nor policie. They
founde in their houses great store of victualles, and an infinite
number of hennes of the countrie, diuers sortes of
metals, and some of them seemed to be very good: they
could not perfectly vnderstande the number of people that
were in that countrie, for that they were fled vnto the
mountaines, as aforesaid.</p>

<p>Being fully certified of the death of them that they went
to seeke for, they entred into counsell to determine whether
they should returne vnto New Biscaya, from whence they
came, or to proceede forwarde; in the which there were
diuers opinions. But by reason that they vnderstoode there,
that towardes the port of the orient from that place, and not
farre distant from that prouince, there were very great
townes and rich, and finding themselues so nigh them, the
captaine Antonio de Espero,<a name="FNanchor_1_67" id="FNanchor_1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> with the consent of the religious
fryer aforesaide, called Bernardino Beltran, and the most
part of his souldiers and companions, determined to proceede
forwardes in the discouerie thereof, till such time as they
did see to what end it would come, that they might the
better giue perfect and iust notice thereof unto his maiestie,
as witnesses that had seene it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_67" id="Footnote_1_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> Misspelt for Espeio.</p></div>

<p>So being in conformitie they determined, they remayning
there sentenela, or royall companie, the captaine, with other
two companions with him, should go forwardes in the demand
of their desire, which foorthwith they put in execution.
So, at the end of two dayes of their trauaile, they came vnto a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_244" id="Page_ii_244">[244]</a></span>
prouince where they discouered aleuen townes [sic], and much
people in them, which, in their iudgement, did passe fortie
thousand soules. It was a countrie very well replenished
and fertile, whose confines are ioyned vnto the lands of the
Cibola, whereas as is great store of kyne, of whose skins
they do apparell themselues and with cotton; hauing the
vse of gouernement amongest them as their neighbours haue.
There are signes and tokens of many rich mynes, and found
in their houses certaine metalles; these Indians do worship
idols: they received the Spaniardes with peace, and
gaue them to eate. Seeing this, and the disposition of the
countrie, they returned vnto their sentenela from whence
they departed, to giue notice vnto their companions of all
that hath beene saide.</p>

<p>So when they were come vnto their companions aforesaide,
they had notice and vnderstanding of an other prouince,
called the Quires, which was vp the riuer on the north, sixe
leagues distant. So they departed thitherwardes; and when
they came within a league of the place, there came foorth in
peace a great companie of Indians, and requested that they
would goe with them vnto their townes; the which they did,
and were verie well entertayned, and had great cheare. In
this prouince they sawe but onely fiue townes, in the which
there was a great number of people, which, vnto their iudgement,
did passe fifteene thousand soules; and doo worship
idolles as their neighbours doo. They found in one of these
townes a pye in a cage, as is the vse in Spaine; and tirasoles,
as those which are brought from China, and painted on them
the sunne and the moone, with many starres: and taking
the altitude thereof, they founde it to be in seuen and thirtie
degrees and a halfe vnder the north poole.</p>

<p>They departed from this prouince, and trauelling by the
same course or rutter, fourteene leagues from thence, they
came to another prouince called the Cunames, whereas they
discouered other fiue townes: and that which was the principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_245" id="Page_ii_245">[245]</a></span>
and biggest of them is called Cia, which was of such
huge bignesse that it had in it eight places: their houses be
plastered with lyme, and painted with diuerse colours, much
better than they had seene in any prouince past. It seemed
that the people that were there did passe in number twentie
thousande soules. They gaue presentes vnto the Spaniardes
with many curious mantelles, and of victualles to eate maruellously
well dressed, and iudged the people to be more
curious, and of more estimation of themselues, than any that
thitherto they had seene, and of greater gouernement. They
<span class="sidenote">Rich metals.</span>
shewed vnto them rich metalles, and the mountaines that
were hard by whereas they did take it out. Here they had
notice of an other prouince which was towards the northwest,
and determined to go thither.</p>

<p>So after they departed from thence, and had trauailed sixe
leagues, they came to the said prouince, which was called
Ameias, in the which was seuen great townes, and in them,
according to their iudgment, thirtie thousand soules: they
said that one of these seuen townes was very great and faire;
the which they would not go to see, for that it was situated
behinde a mountaine, as also they feared some euil successe,
if that they should be deuided the one from the other.
They are people after the fashion of the other prouince their
neighbours, with as much prouision, and as well gouerned.
Fifteene leagues from this prouince, trauelling continually
towards the northwest, they came to a great town, called
Acoma; it had in it more than sixe thousande soules. It
was situated and placed upon a high rock, the which was
more than fiftie fadam in height, and had no other entry but
by a payre of staires, the which was made and cut out of
the same rocke, a thing the which did cause great admiration
vnto the Spaniardes: all the water that they had in this
towne was in cesternes. The principallest hereof came with
peace for to see the Spaniards, and brought them many
mantles, and shamwayes very well dressed, and great quantitie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_246" id="Page_ii_246">[246]</a></span>
of prouision: they haue their corne-fields two leagues
from that place, and for to water them they take water out of
a small riuer there harde by. Upon the saide riuer side they
sawe many fields with roses, like vnto those that are in
Spain. There are many mountaines which shewe to haue
mettals, although they went not vp to see it, for that the
Indians be many, and very warlike people.</p>

<p>The Spaniards remained in this place three daies, in one
of the which the naturall people thereof did make vnto them
a solemne dance, and came foorth in the same with gallant
apparell and with maruellous ingenious pastimes, with the
which they reioyced exceedingly. So four and twentie
leagues from this place, they came vnto a prouince called in
their naturall language Zuny, and the Spaniards do call it
Cibola, there is in it a great number of Indians. In the
which was Francisco Vazquez Coronado, and left there
erected many crosses and many other signes and tokens of
Christendome, which continually did remaine standing.
They found there three christened Indians, which were left
there at that time, whose names were, Andres de Cuyoacon,
Gasper de Mexico, and Antonio de Guadalaiara, who had
almost forgotten their own language, and could speake very
well that of this countrie: yet with a little vse after they had
talked with them they did easily vnderstand them. Of these
they vnderstood, that three score iourneyes from thence was
there a lake, very great, about the which was situated many
excellent good townes, and that the natural people thereof
had very much gold, and it seemed to be true for that they
did all weare braslets and eareringes of the same. The foresaide
Francisco Vazquez Coronado hauing certaine intelligence
of the same, he departed from this prouince of Cibola,
and went that way: and hauing trauelled twelue iourneyes,
his water did faile him, so that he determined to returne
backe againe as he did, with pretence to returne an other
time, when better oportunity should be had: the which afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_247" id="Page_ii_247">[247]</a></span>
he did not put in execution, for that by death all his
determinations and pretences were cut off.</p>

was high time to returne vnto New Bizcaya from whence
they came, for to giue notice of all that they had seene, the
which they did put in execution within few daies after, the
most part of them, and left the captain with alonely nine
companions that would follow him. Who, after that hee had
fully certified himselfe of the riches aboue said, and of the
great quantitie of good metals that were there, he departed
out of this prouince with his companions, and trauelled
towardes the northwest.</p>

<p>So after that they had trauelled eight and twentie leagues,
they came into an other prouince, the which was very great,
in the which to their iudgment were more than fifty thousand
soules: whose inhabitants, when they vnderstood of
their comming, they sent them a messenger, which said, that
if they would not be slaine of them, that they should not approch
any nearer vnto their townes. Unto the which the said
captaine answered, that they came not thether to do them any
harme, as they should well perceiue, and also did request
them that they would not disturbe them in the prosecuting
of their pretence, and gaue vnto the messenger certaine
things such as they carryed with them, who did praise so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_248" id="Page_ii_248">[248]</a></span>
much the Spaniardes, that he did appease the troubled minds
of the Indians, in such sort, that they did of their owne good
wil grant them licence for to enter into their townes. The
which they did with one hundreth and fiftie Indians their
friends, of the prouince of Cibola aforesaide, and with the
three Indians of Mexico of whom we made mention.</p>

<p>Before they came vnto the first towne by a league, there
went foorth to meete and receiue the Spaniards more than
two thousande Indians laden with victualles and prouision,
vnto whome our captaine did giue thinges of small price:
yet it seemed vnto them to be of great estimation, more than
golde. So when they came nigher vnto the towne called
Zaguato, there came foorth to receiue them a great number
of Indians, and amongest them their Caciques, and made a
great showe of mirth and ioy, and threw vppon the ground
much flower of maiz that their horse might tread vpon it.
With these feastes, ioy, and pleasure, they entred into the
towne, whereas they were very well receiued, lodged, and
made much of: the which the captaine did partly recompence,
in giuing vnto all the principallest amongest them,
hattes, and glasse beades, and many other thinges more,
which they carried with them to serue the like oportunitie.</p>

<p>The Caciques did forthwith dispatch and send aduise vnto
all those of that prouince, giuing them to vnderstande of the
comming of their new guestes, and how that they were verie
curteous men, and did no harme. Which was occasion sufficient
to cause them all to come laden with presentes vnto
the Spaniardes, and did request them for to goe vnto their
townes to sport and recreate themselues: the which they did,
but alwaies with great care and respect of what soeuer might
happen. For the which the captaine did vse a policie with
them, which was, that he tolde vnto the Caciques, that for so
much as his horse were verie fierce and furious, and that
they had told them that they would kill them, therefore for
to shunne the damage and harme that might happen vnto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_249" id="Page_ii_249">[249]</a></span>
the Indians, it were requisite to make a fort with lyme and
stone, to put them in. The Caciques did giue such credite
vnto his words, that in a few houres they had ioyned together
so much people, that they made a fort according as the
Spaniardes did request, and that with an incredible breuitie.
Besides this, when the captaine sayd that he would depart,
they brought vnto him a present of fortie thousand mantles
of cotton, some white, and some painted, and a great quantitie
of hand towels with tassels at the corners, and many
other thinges, and amongst them rich metals, which shewed
to haue much siluer. Amongst these Indians they had great
notice and knowledge of the lake aforesaide, and they were
conformable vnto the other, in that touching the great riches
and abundance of gold.</p>

<p>The captaine hauing great confidence in this people and of
their good dispositions, he determined after certaine daies
that he had bin there, to leaue fiue of his companions and
the rest of the Indians his friends, that they might returne
vnto the prouince of Zuny with all their bagage: and hee
himselfe, with the other four that remained, would go more
at quiet to discouer certaine very rich mynes, of the which
he had true notice. So according vnto his determination
he departed with the guides he had, and hauing trauelled
toward the northwest fiue and forty leagues, he came vnto
the sayde mynes, and tooke out of the same with his owne
<span class="sidenote">Rich metals.</span>
hands rich metals, and very much siluer: the mynes had a
great and brode veine, it was vpon a rocke whereas they
might go vp to it with great ease, for that there was a way
open to that effect: nigh thereunto were certain townes of
Indians amongst the mountaines, who shewed friendship
vnto them, and came foorth to receiue them with crosses in
their hands, and other signes and tokens of peace: nigh vnto
the same they saw two reasonable riuers, vppon whose bankes
there were many vines full of excellent good grapes, great walnut
trees, and very much flaxe, like vnto that of Spaine, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_250" id="Page_ii_250">[250]</a></span>
was tolde them by signes, that on the other side of the saide
mountaines there was a riuer of 8 leagues brode. But they
could not vnderstand how nigh it was, yet did they make
demonstration that it did run his course towards the North
Sea, and vpon both sides thereof was situated many townes,
and of so huge bignes, that in comparison those wherein
they were, were but suburbes in respect.</p>

<p>So after the captaine had taken all this relation hee departed
towardes the prouince of Zuny, whither he had commanded
his other companions to goe, and at their comming
thether in health, which was by an other excellent way, he
found therwith his other fiue companions: the father fryer
Bernardino with the souldiers that were determined to returne
backe againe (as aforesayde), for as yet they were not
departed from thence for certayne occasions. Unto whom
the naturals of the countrie had giuen good intertaynement
and all thinges necessarie, and that in abundance: and afterwardes
did the like vnto the sayde captaine and vnto them
that came with him, and went foorth to receiue him with
demonstration of great ioy, and gaue them great store of
prouision for their iourney pretended, requesting him to
returne againe with breuitie, and to bring with him many
Castillas (for so they doo call the Spaniardes), and they
would giue them all to eate: for the which (the better to
accomplish the same) they had sowed that yeare more wheate
and other graine, then they had done in any other yeare
past.</p>

<p>At this present the sayde religious fryer and the rest of
the souldiers did ratifie their first determination aforesaide,
and concluded to returne vnto the prouince from whence
they came, with the pretence before spoken of, and there
ioyned with him in that iourney, Gregorio Hernandez, who
was standert bearer in that attempt.</p>

<p>So when they were departed, the captain, who remained but
with eight souldiers, did fully resolue himselfe to prosecute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_251" id="Page_ii_251">[251]</a></span>
his begun pretence, and to take his course vp alongst the north
riuer: which being put in execution, and hauing trauelled
about sixty leagues towards the prouince of Quires aforesaid,
twelue leagues from thence towards the orient they came
vnto a prouince called Gubates, whereas the Indians receiued
them with peace, and gaue them great store of prouision,
and also notice that not far from thence there were certayne
rich mynes, the which they founde, and tooke out of them
glystering metals and very good, with the which they returned
to the towne from whence they departed.</p>

<p>They iudged this prouince to haue nigh vpon fiue and
twentie thousande soules, all well apparelled with painted
mantles of cotton, and shamwayes skins very well dressed.
There are many mountaynes and woodes of pine cedar trees,
and their houses of foure and fiue stories hie. Heere had
they notice of an other prouince that was but one daies iourney
from thence, which was called of the Tamos, in the
which was more than fortie thousand soules, but when they
came thether the inhabitants would not giue them any
victuals, neyther permit them to enter into their townes; for
the which, to auoyde the danger wherin they were, being
but a few souldiers (as aforesaid) and some of them sicke,
they determined to depart thence towardes the countrie of
Christians, the which they put in execution the beginning of
Iuly in the yere 1583, and were conducted by an Indian
that went with them, who carried them by a contrarie way
and different from that they came, downe alongest the riuer
side, which they called of the Vacas, by reason that there
was great store of kine all alongest the same. By the which
they trauelled one hundred and twentie leagues. From
thence they came vnto the riuer of the Conchos there whereas
they first entred, and from thence vnto the vale of S. Bartholomew,
from whence they departed to begin this discouerie.
And when they came thether they vnderstood that many dayes
before were arriued there in health, frier Bernardino Beltran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_252" id="Page_ii_252">[252]</a></span>
and his companions, and were gone from thence vnto the
village of Guadiana. In this towne the captaine Antonio
de Espeio made a certaine and true information of all this
aforesaide, the which presently he sent vnto the Earle of
Corunnia, viceroy of that kingdome: and he sent it vnto his
maiestie, and vnto the lords of the royall counsell of the
Indians, that therin they might ordaine that which seemed
them best, the which they haue done with great care. I
beseech the Lord God, if it be his pleasure that it may go
forwardes in such order, that so many soules redeemed by
his precious bloud be not condemned: whose wits and vnderstanding
do farre exceed those of Mexico and Peru, as by
the information of those that haue delt with them appeareth,
wherby we may presume that with great facilitie they will
imbrace the law of the gospell, and leaue the idolatrie that
the most part of them do vse, which God for his mercies
sake permit, so it may be for his glorie and exalting of the
Catholike faith.</p>

<p>I haue bin tedious in this relation, more than a commentarie
doth require, but I haue doone it by reason it is a
newe thing and little abrode as yet, and it seemeth to mee
not to giue discontent vnto the reader. And now me thinketh
it shall bee well that I doo returne vnto my matter first
begunne, and to proceede and go forwardes in the voyage
and description of the new worlde, returning vnto the citie
of Mexico, there where as I did digresse for to declare the
discouerie of the Newe Mexico.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Departing from the citie of Mexico, they go vnto the port of Acapulco in
the South Sea, whereas they doo imbarke themselues from the Ilandes
Philippinas; they passe by the Ilandes of Theeues, and do declare the
rites and condition of that people.</i></p></div>


<p>From the citie of Mexico they go to imbarke themselues
or take shipping at the port of Acapulco, which is in the
South Sea, and is eleuated from the poole nineteen degrees,
and ninetie leagues from the citie of Mexico: in al which
way there be many townes inhabited with Indians and
Spaniards.</p>

<p>Being departed from this port, they sayle towards the
southwest, till they come into twelue degrees and a halfe,
to seeke prosperous wind to serue their turne, which the
mariners do cal Brizas, and are northerly windes, which are
there of such continuance and so fauourable that, being in
the moneths of Nouember, December, and Januarie, they
haue no neede to touch their sayles, which is the occasion
that they do make their voyages with so great ease. So that
for that, and for the few stormes that happened in that passage,
<span class="sidenote">The sea of Ladies.</span>
they do cal it the Mar de Damas (which is the sea of
Ladies). They sayle alwayes towards the west, following
the sunne when as she departeth from our hemispherie. In
this South Sea they sayle fortie daies without seeing anie
lande: at the end whereof they came to the ilandes of Velas,
which by another name are called De los Ladrones; there
are seuen or eight of them; they doo lye north and south,
and are inhabited with much people, in the order as you
shall vnderstand.</p>

<p>These ilands are in 12 degrees, but there are different
opinions of the leagues that are betwixt the port of Acapulco
and those ilands; for vnto this day there is none that hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_254" id="Page_ii_254">[254]</a></span>
vnderstood the certaintie thereof, for that their nauigation
lieth from the east vnto the west, whose degrees there haue
bin none that euer could measure. Some say, this iourney
hath a thousande and seuen hundred leagues, others a
thousand and eight hundred; but the opinions of the first
we vnderstand to be most certaine.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">White people as bigge as gyants.</span>
All these ilands are inhabited with white people, of comely
faces, like vnto those of Europa, but not of their bodies, for
that they are as bigge as gyants, and of so great force and
strength: for one of them hath taken two Spaniardes, of
a good stature, the one by one foot, and the other by the
other, with his handes, and hath lifted them both from the
grounde with so great ease, as though they had bin two
children. They go naked from top to toe, as well women as
men; yet some of them were woont to weare an aporne
made of a deares skinne before them of halfe a yeard long,
for honesties sake, but they are but a fewe in number, in
respect of those that weare nothing before them. The
weapons which they do vse be slinges, and darts hardened
in the fire, and are with both the one and the other very
expert throwers.</p>

<p>They do maintaine themselues with fish which they do take
on the coast; and of wild beasts which they do kill in the
mountaines, in ouertaking of them by swiftnesse of foot.</p>

<p>In these ilands there is one the strangest costume that
euer hath bin heard of or seene in all the whole world,
which is, that vnto the young men there is a time limited for
them to marrie in (according vnto their custome), in all
which time they may freely enter into the houses of such as
are married, and be there with their wiues, without being
punished for the same, although their proper husbands
should see them: they doo carrie in their handes a staffe or
rodde, and when they do enter into the married mans house
they do leaue it standing at the doore, in such sort, that if any
do come after they may plainly see it: which is a token that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_255" id="Page_ii_255">[255]</a></span>
although it be her proper husband, he cannot enter in till it
be taken away. The which custome is obserued and kept
with so great rigour and force, that whosoeuer is against this
lawe, all the rest do kill him.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Without king or gouernor.</span>
In all these ilands there is not as yet knowen neyther king
nor lord, whom the rest should obey; which is the occasion
that euery one do liue as he list and at his pleasure. These
ilandes were woont to haue warre the one with the other,
when occasion did force them. As it happened at such time
as the Spaniardes were there in the port of the said iland,
there came abord their ships to the number of two hundred
small barkes or botes, in the which came many of the inhabitants
thereof to sell, vnto them of the ships, hens, and nuts
called cocos, patatas, and other thinges of that iland; and to
buy other such things as our people did carrie with them,
but in especiall yron (vnto the which they are very much
affectionated), and vnto things of chrystall, and such like
of small estimation. But there grew a great contention
amongest them, which people of what ilande should first
come vnto the shippes, and was in such order that they fell
vnto blowes, and wounded the one the other maruellously,
more liker beastes than men; of the which there were many
slaine in the presence of the Spaniards, and would neuer
leave off their contention a good while, till in the end, by
way of peace, they consented a conclusion amongest themselues,
but with a great noyse, which was, that those of one
iland should go to the larbord of the ship, and those of the
other iland should go to the starbord; with the which they
were pacified, and did buy and sel at their pleasure. But at
their departure from our people, in recompence of their good
intertainment, they threw into the ship of their dartes hardened
with fire, with the which they did hurt many of them
that were aboue hatches: yet went they not away scotfree,
for that our people with their hargabushes did paye them in
readie monie their bold attempt.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Iron more esteemed than siluer or gold.</span>
These people do more esteeme yron than siluer or golde,
and gaue for it fruites, nnames,<a name="FNanchor_1_68" id="FNanchor_1_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> patatas, fish, rise, ginger,
hennes, and many gallant mattes very well wrought, and all
almost for nothing.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_68" id="Footnote_1_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> The Spanish word is "ñames", in all probability meant for "yams".</p></div>

<p>These ilandes are verie fertile and healthfull, and very
easie to bee conquered unto the fayth of Christ, if that at
such time as the ships doo passe that way vnto Manilla, they
would leaue there some religious men, with souldiers to
garde them till the next yeare, and might be doone with
small cost. It is not as yet known what ceremonies and rites
they do obserue; for that there is none that doo vnderstande
their language, neither hath any beene on those ilandes, but
onely as they haue passed by, which is the occasion that they
cannot be vnderstood. The language which they doo vse, to
any mans iudgement, is easie to be learned, for that their pronunciation
is verie plaine; they call ginger <i>asno</i>, and for to say
Take away your hargabush, they say, <i>arrepeque</i>. The pronunciation
of their wordes is neither in the nose nor in the
throte. It is vnderstood that they be all Gentiles, by certaine
signes and tokens that our people haue seene them do,
and that they doo worship idols, and the diuell, vnto whom
they do sacrifice such as they do take in the warres of their
borderers. It is thought that they doo descend of the Tartares,
by some particularities that is found amongst them, the
which do draw very nigh vnto some that they do vse.</p>

<p>These ilandes are south and north with the land of Labrador,
which is nigh vnto the new found lande, and not farre
distant from the ilande of Japon. It is knowen for a trueth
that they do deale with the Tartares, and that they do buy
yron for to sell it vnto them. The Spaniards did giue name
vnto these ilandes as they passed by, the ilandes of Ladrones
(which is of theeues), for that they are very bolde and
subtile in their stealinges, in the which facultie the Egyptians,
that are in our Europa, may go to schoole with them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_257" id="Page_ii_257">[257]</a></span>
for the verie facultie thereof. I will declare vnto you one
thing that happened in the presence of many Spaniardes, the
which did cause them greatly to maruaile, which is,&mdash;there
was a marriner commanded by the captaine of the ship to
keepe the sterneborde side, and not to suffer any of them to
enter therein; and being as one amased to see so many
canoas that came thether (the which be small barkes or botes
made all of one peece) one of them diued downe vnder the
water, till he came there whereas the marriner was (vnmindfull
of any such matter should happen) and vpon a soddaine,
without seeing the other, he snatched his sword out of his
hand, and went vnder the water againe therwith; the marriner
made a noise, and declared the knauerie that the ilander
had done vnto him, whervpon there were certaine souldiers
that made their hargubushes ready to shoot at him when he
appeared from vnder the water. This ilander perceiuing
it, came foorth and swimmed aboue the water, shewing his
handes, and made signes that he had nothing in them, which
was the occasion that they did not shoot at him.</p>

<p>So after a while that he had beene there resting of himselfe,
he returned and diued vnder the water againe, and
swam so farre as he thought that the bullet of the hargubush
could not reach to hurt him, and finding himselfe in securitie,
he tooke the sword from betwixt his legges whereas he
did carrie it in secret, and beganne to florish with the same,
mocking our people whom he had so easily deceiued.</p>

<p>This kind of stealing, and many others which they had
done, and that with great subtiltie, is the occasion that they
beare the names of theeues, and all the ilandes whereas they
doo dwell doo beare the name thereof, the which they will
easily pardon, if they might ordinarily finde where as they
might execute their inclination.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>They departe from the Ilandes of the Ladrones, and come vnto them of
Luzon, or Philippinas by an other name, and doo declare the particular
thoughts of those ilandes.</i></p></div>


<p>From this Iland of Ladrones nauigating towards the west,
almost two hundred leagues, till they came to a mouth called
of the Holy Ghost, they straightwaies doo enter into the
<span class="sidenote">Archipelago.</span>
Archipelago (which is an infinite number of ilands), almost
all inhabited with their own naturall people; but many conquered
by the Spaniardes, eyther by force of warre or friendship.
Four score leagues from this is the citie of Manilla,
<span class="sidenote">The Island of Luzon, and citie of Manilla.</span>
which is vpon the Iland of Luzon, there whereas ordinarily
dwelleth the gouernor of all those ilandes, and the officers of
his maiestie: therein is a bishop and a cathedrall church.
This citie standeth in fourteen degrees and a quarter, and
round about the same there are so many ilandes, that vnto
this day there is none that euer could number them: they
do extend all of them northwest and southwest, and north
and south, in so much that the one part stretcheth vnto the
Straight of Sincapura which is fiue and twentie leagues from
Malaca, and the other part vnto the Malucos, and other
ilandes, whereas they gather a great number of cloues,
<span class="sidenote">Great mountains of pepper, cloues, and ginger.</span>
pepper, and ginger, of the which there are great mountaines
full. The first that discouered these ilands were Spaniards,
which came to them in the company of the famous Magellanes,
and made no conquest of them, for that they knew
better to nauigate then to conquer; by reason whereof, after
they had discouered and passed the straight (which vnto this
day beareth the title of his name) and came vnto the Ilande
of Zubu, whereas they did baptise certaine of the inhabitance,
and afterwards in a banket, the same ilanders did kill
him and other forty of his companions, which was the occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_259" id="Page_ii_259">[259]</a></span>
that Sebastian de Guetaria, a naturall Biskin borne,<a name="FNanchor_1_69" id="FNanchor_1_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> for
to escape with his life, did put himselfe in a shippe that remained
of the voyage (which afterwards was named the
Victorie), and in her and with a few people that helped him,
with the fauour of God he came vnto Siuell, hauing compassed
the whole world, from the Orient vnto the Ponient, a
thing which caused vnto all men great admiration, but in
particular vnto the Emperor Charles the Fift of famous
memorie, who after he had giuen many gifts and fauours
vnto the said Sebastian de Guetaria, hee gaue order that a
new armie should be made ready, and to returne againe in
demande of the said ilands, and to discouer that new world.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_69" id="Footnote_1_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_69"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> A native of Biscay.</p></div>

<p>So when all things were in a readinesse for to depart on
their voyage (the which was done with great breuitie) they
ordained for generall of all that fleete one Villa Lobos, commanding
him to go by the Nueua Espania. This Villa
Lobos arriued at the Ilands of Malucas, and at those of
Terrenate, and at other ilands ioyning vnto them, the which
ilands were laid to gage by the aforesaid emperor vnto the
crowne of Portugal.</p>

<p>In these ilands they had great wars by meanes of the Portugals,
and seeing themselues with little helpe and small
resistance for to go forwards with their conquests, they left it
off, and went to the most part of them with the aforesaide
Portugals vnto the India of Portugall, from whence afterwards
they sent them as prisoners unto the said king of Portugall,
as offenders that had entred his ilands without his
licence: who did not onely leaue to do them any harme, but
did intreate them very well and sent them vnto their owne
country of Spaine, and gaue them al thinges necessary for
their iourney, and that in aboundance.</p>

<p>Then certaine yeares after, Don Philip king of Spaine
being very willing that the discouering shoulde go forwards,
which the emperor his father had so earnestly procured, sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_260" id="Page_ii_260">[260]</a></span>
and commanded Don Luys de Velasco, who was his vizroy
of the Nuoua Espania, that he would ordaine an army and
people for to returne and discouer the said ilands, and to
sende in the said fleete, for gouernor of all that should bee
discouered, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, who did accomplish
all that his maiestie had commanded, and made the discouerie
thereof in such order, as in the first relation of the
entrie of the fathers of the order of Saint Austen into the
China dooth more at large appeare.</p>

<p>Of ancient time these ilands were subiect vnto the king of
China, vntill such time as hee did deliuer them vp of his
owne free will, for such reasons as were spoken off in the
first part of this historie: and that was the occasion that
when the Spaniards came vnto them, they were without
lorde or heade, or anie other to whome they shoulde showe
duetie, but hee which had most power and people did most
command: so that this (and that there were so many of
equal power) was the occasion that ciuill warres continued,
without any respect of nature, kinred, or any other duety,
but like vnto brute beastes, killing, spoiling, and captiving
one another, the which was a great helpe vnto the Spaniards
for to subiect that countrie with so great ease vnto the king,
and called them the Ilands Philippinas in respect of his
name. They did vse amongst them to make captiues and
slaues such as they did take in vnlawfull wars, and for trifling
matters, the which God did remedie by the going thither of
the Spaniards: for you should haue a man with fortie or fiftie
other friends in his company, or seruants, that vpon a sodaine
would go and set vpon a small village of poore people and
vnprouided, and take and binde them all, and carrie them
away for slaues without any occasion or reason, and make
them to serue them all the dayes of their life, or else sell
them to other ilands. And if it so chanced that one did
lende vnto another a basket or two of rice (the which might
bee woorth a ryall of plate), with condition to returne it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_261" id="Page_ii_261">[261]</a></span>
againe within ten dayes; if the debter did not pay it the
same day, the next day following he should pay it dooble,
and afterward to double it euery day so long as he did keepe
it, which in conclusion the debt would grow to be so great,
that, to pay the same, he is forced to yeeld himselfe for captiue
and slaue.</p>

<p>But vnto all such as were captiued in this order, or in
such like, the king of Spaine hath commanded to giue libertie;
yet this iust commandement is not in euery point fulfilled
and accomplished, because such as should execute the
same haue interest therein. All these ilandes were gentiles
and idolaters, but now there is amongest them many thousands
baptised, vnto whom the king hath shewed great
mercie, in sending vnto them the remedie for their soules in
so good time: for if the Spaniards had stayed any more
yeares, they had beene all Moores at this day, for that there
were come vnto the Ilande of Burneo some of that sect that
did teach them, and lacked little, for to worship that false
prophet Mahomet, whose false, peruerse, and corrupt memory,
was with the gospell of Christ easily rooted out.</p>

<p>In al these ilands they did worshippe the sunne and
moone, and other second causes, figures of men and women,
which are called in their language Maganitos, at whose
feastes (which they do make very sumptuous, with great
ceremonies and superstition) they doo call Magaduras. But
amongst them all, they have in most veneration an idoll whome
they called Batala, the which reuerence they had for a tradition;
yet can they not say what should be the occasion
that he should deserue more then any of the rest to bee had in
so great estimation. In certaine ilandes not farre off, called
<span class="sidenote">The diuell was worshiped.</span>
the Illocos, they did worship the diuell, and made vnto him
many sacrifices, in recompence of a great quantitie of gold
hee had giuen vnto them; but nowe by the goodnesse of God,
and the great diligence put and done by the fathers of the
order of Saint Austen (who were the first that passed into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_262" id="Page_ii_262">[262]</a></span>
these parts, and liued worthely) and also by the friers of
Saint Francis, which went thither tenne yeares after, all
these ilands or the most part of them are baptised, and vnder
the ensigne of Jesus Christ: and the rest which doo remaine
and are not, is more for lacke of ministers and preachers,
then for any obstinacie of their parts. There is nowe gone
thither certaine fathers of the order called Iesuits, who will
be a helpe vnto them with their accustomed zeale and labour.
And nowe goeth thither many other religious men, very well
learned and apostolike, of the order of Saint Dominicke, who
will doo their indeuour to conuert them vnto Christ, as it
behooueth Christians to do.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_III_XIII" id="CHAP_III_XIII"></a>CHAP. XIII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Here is declared of some notable things that are, and haue beene
seene in these Ilands Philippinas.</i></p></div>


<p>They of these ilandes were accustomed to celebrate their
feastes aforesaid, and to make sacrifices vnto their idols, by
<span class="sidenote">Witches.</span>
the order of certaine women which were witches, whome
they do call in their language Holgoi, that were had in as
great estimation amongst them, as be the priests amongst
Christians. These did talke ordinarily with the diuell, and
many times in publike, and do diuellish witchcrafts both in
words and deeds: into whom it is to be beleeued that the
diuell did enter, for that straightwayes they did answere
vnto all things that were demanded of them, although for
the most part they woulde tell a lie, or els such wordes that
might be giuen diuers interpretations of, and of diuers vnderstandings.
They did also vse to cast lottes, in such sorte as
hath bene declared in the first part of this history: they were
great Agorismers<a name="FNanchor_1_70" id="FNanchor_1_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> or observers of times: in so much that if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_263" id="Page_ii_263">[263]</a></span>
they begin any iourney, and at the beginning they meete
with a cayman, or lyzarde, or any other sauage worme, they
knowe it to be a signe of euill fortune, whereupon they
would straightwayes leaue off their iourney, although it did
import them very much, and returne vnto their houses, saying,
that the heauen will not that they shoulde go forwards
on that iourney: but all these lies and falsenes which beene
taught them, and they perswaded to, by the diuell, is ouerthrowne
and taken away by the law of the gospel (as aforesaide),
and haue now amongst them many monasteries full of
religious men, of the order of Saint Austen, Saint Francis,
and of Iesuits. According vnto the common opinion, at this
day there is conuerted and baptised more then foure hundred
thousand soules, which is a great number: yet in
respect of the quantitie that are not as yet conuerted, there
are but a few. It is left vndone (as aforesaid) for want of
ministers, for that, although his maiesty doth ordinarily send
thither without any respect of the great charge in doing the
same, yet by reason that there are so many ilands, and euerie
day they doo discouer more and more, and being so far off,
they cannot come vnto them all, as necessitie requireth.
Such as are baptised, doo receiue the fayth with great firmenesse,
and are good Christians, and would be better, if that
they were holpen with good ensamples: as those which haue
beene there so long time are bounde to doe: that the lacke
thereof doth cause some of the inhabitantes so much to
abhorre them, that they would not see them once paynted
vpon a wall. For proofe whereof (and for to moue such as
haue power and authoritie to put remedie in the same, I will
declare vnto you here a strange case, the which royally did
passe of a trueth in one of these ilandes, and is verie well
knowne amongst them: that is, there chanced to die an
ilander, a principall man amongst them, a few dayes after
that he was baptised, being very contrite for his sinnes the
which hee had done against God before he was baptised; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_264" id="Page_ii_264">[264]</a></span>
after hee died. So after by the diuine permission of God he
appeared vnto many of that ilande, whom he did perswade
forthwith to receiue the baptisme, with reasons of great
efficacie, and declared vnto them (as one that had experiencd
the same) the rewarde of that good deede which without all
doubt shoulde bee giuen vnto them, if they would receiue
the same, and liue after conformable and according vnto the
commandements of Christ; for the which he told them and
said, that forthwith so soone as he was dead, he was carried
by the angels into glorie, there whereas all things were of
delite, pleasure, and content, and did communicate onely in
the sight of God, and that there was none that entred
therein, neither coulde enter, except hee were baptised,
according vnto the preaching of the Spaniards, of whome
and of others that were like vnto them, there was infinite
number. Therefore if so be that they would go and inioy
of those benefites and delights, it is necessarie that first they
should be baptised, and afterwards to obserue and keepe the
commandements that be preached vnto them by the fathers,
that are amongst the Castillas, and therewith he vanished
away, and they remained treating amongst themselues concerning
that which they had hearde, and was the occasion
that some of them forthwith receiued the baptisme, and that
<span class="sidenote">The Indians would not go into heauen because
there were Spanish souldiers.</span>
others did delay it, saying, that because there were Spaniard
souldiers in glory, they would not go thither, because they
would not be in their company.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_70" id="Footnote_1_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> The Spanish word is "agoreros", soothsayers or superstitious persons,
from <i>aguero</i>, an omen.</p></div>

<p>All this hurt is done by one peruerse or impious man, and
with one euill ensample, the which amongst many good, as
you haue in those parts; but in especiall amongst them
in particular, it ought to bee reprehended and punished
seuerely with rigour.</p>

<p>These ilands, at the first discouery of them, had the fame
to bee <i>mal sanos</i>, or vnholesome, but since experience hath
shewed and prooued it to the contrarie. It is a countrie
maruellous fertill, and yeeldeth very much rice, wheate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_265" id="Page_ii_265">[265]</a></span>
goates, hennes, deere, buffes, kine, and great stoare of hogges,
whose flesh is so sauorie as the mutton they haue in Spaine:

fruites, which be very good and sauorie: great aboundance
<span class="sidenote">Honie.</span>

<span class="sidenote">Sinamum.</span>
it is solde for nothing. Also there is great stoare of synamon,

out of the Nuoua Espania: they haue much oyle of algongoli<a name="FNanchor_1_71" id="FNanchor_1_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Linseed oile.</span>

<p>But amongst all other notable thinges that these Spaniards
haue seene in those ilands, and in the kingdome of China,
and other places whereas they passed, there is one thing
which hath caused them most to maruel at, and to haue it
most in memory; which is a tree, ordinarily called palma de
cocos, but doth differ from that which beareth the dates, and
with great reason, for that it is a plant so full of mysterie
and profite, that there hath come a ship vnto these ilands,
and the said ship, and all that was in her to be sold, with
ropes, cords, masts, sailes and nailes, were made of this tree,
and the merchandice that she brought was mantels made of
the rind of the saide tree, with great subtiltie and fine works.
Likewise all the victuals that was in the said ship for the
sustentation of thirtie men that came in her, yea their water
was of the same tree.</p>

<p>The merchants that came in this ship did certifie of a truth,
in all the Iland of Maldiuia from whence they came, they
haue no other sustainment, but onely that which this tree
yeeldeth: they do make houses hereof, and tyles for to couer
the same, the fruit doth yeeld a meollio or curnell, which is
very sauory and healthfull, the sauor thereof is much like to
greene hasell nuts, and if you do cut the branch there
whereas the coco commeth forth is the principall fruite, and
euery one of them hath ordinarily a pinte of water, the which
is very sweet and delicate: al the said substance doth returne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_267" id="Page_ii_267">[267]</a></span>
into the trunke of the tree, whereas they doo bore a hole,
and thereat they do draw out all that water, which is much:
and mingling it with other thinges they make thereof good
wine, the which is drunk in al those ilands and in the kingdome
of China. Of the same water they make vineger, and
of the meollio kernell aforesaide, oile verie medicinall, milke
like vnto almon milke: hony and suger very sauorie. These
and many other vertues hath this palme, whereof I haue declared
part, for that they are notable, and do cause admiration
vnto all men that passe into those partes: I doo leaue
to declare the rest because I would not be tedious. Nigh to
the cittie of Manilla, on the other side of the riuer, there is
a towne of Chinos that be baptized, such as haue remained
there to dwell to inioy the libertie of the gospel. There are
amongst them many handicrafts men, as shoomakers, taylors,
goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and other officers, and some merchants.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAP_III_XIV" id="CHAP_III_XIV"></a>CHAP. XIV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The barefoote friers depart from the Iland of Luzon vnto China, and
is declared such as was there seene.</i></p></div>


<p>For that the principall intent of these religious men, when
they went out of Spaine, was for to go vnto the mightie
kingdome of China for to preach the holy gospell, and did
perseuer continually with that desire, they woulde neuer
intreat of any other thing, but onely to put it in execution:
and for the accomplishing of the same, they sought many
meanes and waies, sometimes in requesting the gouernor of
his aide and helpe to procure the same, for that it was an
easie thing to be performed, hauing continually ships of the
merchants of China in the port of Manilla.</p>

<p>The gouernor did driue them off with many reasons, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_268" id="Page_ii_268">[268]</a></span>
principally he laid before them that rigorous lawe, which
they knew was established against such as did enter into that
kingdome without particular licence; yet notwithstanding, all
this was not sufficient to abate the louing desire of those
friers, which was only setled in their mindes for to go and
preach the holy gospel in that kingdome by one meanes or
other, although it were to put their liues in hazard: and for
the prosecuting hereof, the comissary of those ilands, who
was frier Geronimo de Burgos, did elect sixe religious men
for the same purpose: amongst them was the father Ignatio,
of whome I (as I haue said) vnderstood by writing and relation
many thinges, the which is declared in these [sic] itinerario
or comentarie: so that there was with him seuen religious
men, all seruants of God, and very desirous of the saluation
of soules, which was the occasion that they put themselues in
so long and tedious a iourney, leauing their owne countrie
and quietnesse. These seuen, with the good will of the
gouernor Don Gonsalo Ronquillo and of the bishop, whom
they did ouercome and winne with requests and perseuerance,
and carried in their company a Spaniard their friende,
called Iohn de Feria, of Andolozia, and other two souldiers
that went with pretence to become friers, one Portugall, and
sixe Indian ilanders: all the which, the eight day after
Corpus Christi, which was the one and twentie day of Iune,
in anno 1582, they departed from the port of Cabite, whereas
they did imbarke themselues in a barke of the saide Iohn de
Feria, and making saile at fiue of the clocke in the afternoone,
in the morning betimes they founde themselues twentie
leagues ouerthwart the port that is called Dol Fraile,
whereas they determined to go to sea, leauing the coast of
the Ilande of Manilla, which lieth north and south with
China: from the which cittie, which is (as I haue saide) in
fourteene degrees and a halfe, vnto the Cape of Boxeador,
which is in nineteene, it is one hundreth leagues sailing, and
from this cape to the firme land of China, they count it scarce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_269" id="Page_ii_269">[269]</a></span>
fourescore leagues. And God was so pleased, although they
had two dayes calme, the seuenth day, which was the day
before the apostle Saint Peter and Saint Paule, at eight of
the clocke in the morning, they discouered the firme lande
of China: then straightwaies vpon the sight thereof, the
comissarie commaunded to bring foorth the habites which
hee carried readie made for to put vpon the friers, for that
when the Chinos shoulde see that they were all friers, they
should be voide of all suspition, to thinke them to be spies,
as they thought when the first friers went thither (as hath
beene tolde you); and not contented herewith, hee threw all
the souldiers apparell into the sea, and one hargabus of Iohn
de Feria, with the flaske wherein he carried his powder, and
all other thinges such as he thought woulde be a hurt and
hindrance vnto them, if it should so fall out that they shoulde
erre out of the port whereas the Portugals doo vse, and fall
vppon the coast, as afterwards it so fell out: they left nothing
but a match, which they forgot, which lacked very little to
haue cost them full deere. But when they had sight of
the lande, they did not well knowe it, for that they had
neuer seene it before, and were also ignorant of the ports;
although they were very neere to the bay of Canton, they
tooke their course vnto the northwest, wheras they should
haue gone to the southwest, which was the occasion that
they came vnto the prouince of Chincheo. This day, at fiue
a clocke in the afternoone, they discouered a port that was
not farre from them, whither they sailed and entred in, and
came to an anker on the outmost side, yet with great feare
and dread, for that they knew not the securitie thereof,
neither the trouble that might happen.</p>

<p>They were not so soone at an anker, but they saw come
forth of the said port many barkes, both small and great, and
in them many souldiers with hargabusses, lances, swordes,
and targets, and in their foreshippe some small peeces of
ordinance. And when they came nigh vnto the barke wherein
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_270" id="Page_ii_270">[270]</a></span>
the Spaniards were, within musket shot, they stayed and
discharged great stoare of hargabus shot. But they, who
carried no armor to offende others, neither to defende themselues,
the answere that they gaue vnto the shot, was making
of many signes of peace, calling them with their handes to
come nearer vnto them, that they might see and vnderstand
that they came not thither with any pretence to do harme:
yet all was not sufficient to cause them to leaue off their
shooting, neither to come any nearer vnto their barke. At
this present there was amongst the souldiers one Chino, that
had beene at Luzon, and did knowe the Spaniards, being of
God inspired: hee made signes vnto the rest to leaue off
their shooting, which presently they did: and hee came with
his brigantine vnto their barke, and after him all the rest:
who, when they sawe that they had neyther armour nor
weapon, neither will to flie from them, they entered into the
barke, and with their naked swordes in their handes flourishing
with them ouer the heads of the Spaniards, with a great
noise and tumult, they carried them into the port, which was
called Capsonson, whereas was a generall of a great armie of
shippes that were at an anker in the saide port, who straightwaies
commanded that there should be carried on borde his
admirall foure of the Spaniards, the which they vnderstoode
was doone to take their liues from them: for the which, by
reason they did not name any person, foure religious men
did offer themselues to goe, and after they had confessed
themselues, they tooke their leaue of their companions, and
carried euery one of them a crosse in his hande, and his
breuiarie, without any other thing else.</p>

<p>So when they came before the captaine, they founde him
more meeker and milder than they thought to haue done
(surely a worke done by God, in recompence of the great
perill that those his seruants did put themselues in to doo
his seruice and commandement). He asked of them, from
whence they came, and wherefore? with many other questions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_271" id="Page_ii_271">[271]</a></span>
in effect; but when that hee was certified of the truth, hee
commanded them to returne againe vnto their barke, without
doing vnto them anie other harme; yet with a straite precept
that they should not go forth without his expresse licence.</p>

<p>So with this commandement they remained in their barke
three dayes, guarded with many barkes and souldiers: and
the last of them, the captaine sent for two of the religious
men; and when they came before him, he commanded them
to be carried before a iustice, a friend of his there hard by.
These iustices did talke with them with so great grauitie, and
signes of cruelty, that euery time they came before them
they thought verely that forthwith they would command
them to be carried to be executed: and without all doubt,
either they had wil to do it, or else to put them in great feare
of death, for that it was plainely seene in diuers things they
commanded: but especially in one day there came vnto them
a iudge, with many armed men, and compassed their barke
round about with a great number of brigandines, with
plaine signes to giue them assalt, or else to sinke them: but
within a little while they were all in quiet, and the iudge
entred into a shippe that was thereby at anker, and being
set in a rich chaire, guarded with many souldiers about him,
hee commanded the rest that were in the brigandines forthwith
to go to visite and search their barke, and sent with
them an interpreter, one of Chincheo, who did a little vnderstande
the Portugall tongue. These souldiers carried in
their handes blacke banners, and other heauie and sorowfull
signes (which is vsed in that kingdome, when at any time
they doo execute anie person). So after they had made their
visitation, although they founde in their barke not anie prohibited
thing, but onely the match which I haue spoken off,
they commanded that they shoulde forthwith bee imbarked
two and two into the brigandines, whereas the armed souldiers
were, who did direct their foreshippes towardes a towre,
which was a prison, wherein was put all such theeues as were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_272" id="Page_ii_272">[272]</a></span>
taken vpon the coast, out of the which there commeth none
forth but vnto execution. But when the Indians of the
ilands saw it, they wept bitterly, which moued the Spaniards
vnto great compassion; although they were themselues in the
same trance and perill, and as nigh their death, and made no
other reckoning; insomuch that two of the religious men
seeing them so nigh the towre (although when as they were
farre off, they made shewe as though they cared not for it), yet
at that time they were so farre from all reason and vnderstanding,
that al the night one of them knewe not what he did,
without any knowledge of the people wherein he was, but
lay as a deade man: and the other with pure imagination
and melancholike humour fel into a great infirmitie, whereof
within a few dayes after he died in the cittie of Canton.
But in conclusion, the stowtest of them all had feare enough,
and would haue giuen his life for a small matter, for that he
was without all hope, and thought verely that they carried
them vnto execution: which was the occasion that a Spaniard,
one of them that went with pretence to be a frier, and the
habite on, hauing in his power a thousand and sixe hundred
rials of plate, he threw them into the sea, saying, Seeing that
I am going to dye, I wil that it be in the habite of S. Francis,
with the pouerty in which the glorious saint liued and died,
for to follow him in his steps aright. With this feare aforesaid
they were carried towards the tower: but when they
came nigh to it, there followed after the souldiers that carried
them, a skiffe with many oares, in great hast, and called a
loud vnto them, saying, that the captaine general commanded
that they should bring backe againe those prisoners to his
shippe, the which forthwith they accomplished: and after
he had demanded of them certain questions, he commanded
to carry them to the said tower; the which was done, as
they could perceiue, for to put them in more feare. So after
they had feared and scared them with this rigorous temtation,
the saide captaine himselfe went into one of the brigandines,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_273" id="Page_ii_273">[273]</a></span>
and went with them on land; whereas presently when he
came on shoare, hee carryed the Spaniards into a temple of
their idols, vnto whome hee did his accustomed reuerence;
yet the religious men, although they were with great feare
of death as aforesaide, they woulde not imitate him, but
turned their faces from their idols and did spit at them,
giuing the captaine to vnderstande by signes, that he should
not worshippe them, for that they had no more goodnesse in
them then was giuen by man; so that, by good reason to the
contrary, those idols should giue reuerence vnto men, because
they made them; and to whome they ought to giue
their true worship is vnto the true God, the Creator of
heaven and earth.</p>

<p>By this act it is plainely to bee seene the gift of strength,
the which the Holy Ghost doth giue vnto his baptized
Christians, as in these religious men that were at deathes
doore, yet had they strength and spirit for to resist and
reprehende them that could take away their liues. The
captaine, although he made a shew that he was offended
with that which hee had seene them do, yet he did them no
harme, but presently brought them out of the temple, and
commanded the souldiers to remaine there and guard them
all that night: the which they passed lying vpon the grounde,
and yet thought themselues happie, and gaue thankes to
God for that he had deliuered them from the death that was
so nigh vnto them.</p>

vnderstand, the second time they entred into the kingdome of China,
and of the troubles they passed.</i></p></div>


<p>The next day in the morning, the priest of the idols did
open the temple, whereas presently they put in the Spanish
religious men, who sawe him and his ministers lighting of
little candels, and making perfumes vnto their idols, with
manie superstitious ceremonies; the which being done, they
cast certaine lottes (a thing much vsed amongst them), as
they vnderstoode it was done for to consult with the diuell
(who was within those idols) to know what they should do
with them, yet this they could not perfectly vnderstand; but
straightwaies they were carried out of the temple, and
brought by the souldiers before a iudge, who was the chiefe
and principall of all the sea of that prouince, and was sixe
leagues from the place in a cittie called Quixue: the way
thither was very plaine and brode, and paued, and vpon
both sides there were fields both of corne and flowers. So
with the helpe of God the Spaniards came before the presence
of this general in eight days, although it was with
great trauell, by reason they had neither force nor strength
for to trauell, for that they had lost it with the heauie and
sorowful newes as aforesaid.</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding, at their comming to the citty Quixue,
the souldiers had them in continuall guard and keeping till
the next day following; then they were carried before the
generall, where he was in a very great and faire house, the
which had two courts, one of them was next vnto the doore
of the streete, and the other was towards the farther partes
of the house; both of them were railed round about in
manner of grates: they were planted full of diuers sortes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_275" id="Page_ii_275">[275]</a></span>
great trees, wherein did feed a great number of deere and
other wilde beasts, but yet as tame as sheepe. Right ouer
against the inwarde court there was a gallerie, whereon was
many souldiers which did guarde and keepe the person of
the generall, who was in a mightie great and gallant hall, set
in an iuorie chaire with great maiestie. Before they entred
into the seconde court, there was discharged within, both
artilerie and hagabus shot, and played vpon a drum, which
was as bigge as those which they vse in Spaine: that being
doone, there was a great sounde of hoybuckes and trumpets,
and of many other instrumentes: the which being doone,
they straightwayes opened the gates of the innermost court,
whereas the gallerie was aforesaide, from whence they might
see the throne whereas the generall was set. There was
before him a table whereon was paper and other necessaries
for to write (a thing commonly vsed in all that countrie):
the souldiers that were his guarde were all in one liuerie of
silke, and were in so gallant consort, and had so great
sylence, which made the Spaniards greatly to maruell: the
first order was of the hargabushes, and the seconde were
pikes, and betwixt the one and the other was placed a
sworde and a target; there might be about foure hundred
souldiers. Behinde them were placed the officers of iustice,
or executioners, with their instruments for to whippe and
punish offenders: and in the midst of them were the
scriueners and proctors.</p>

<p>About thirtie paces, more or lesse, from the chaire where
the generall was set, was placed certaine gentlemen, and to
the number of a dozen pages, bare headed, verie gallantlie
apparelled in silke and golde. In the middest amongst
these souldiers were the Spaniards carried, and before them
such tokens and shewes as they doo vse when as they doo
present before the iudges such as bee condemned vnto death.
A good way before they came nigh vnto the place whereas
the general was, they caused them to kneele downe: at which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_276" id="Page_ii_276">[276]</a></span>
instant there was brought foorth certaine Chinos, that were
prisoners, to be iudged; and so soone as their inditement
was read, and iudgement giuen, the executioners did execute
the rigour of the sentence in the presence of the Spaniards,
first pulling off their apparell, and then making fast their
hands and feete verie fast with cordes, in such sort, that they
shriked that the noise reached vnto heauens: they kept
them so bounde vntil they sawe farther what the iudge
woulde commaunde, who, when hee had heard his inditement,
if hee woulde that hee should be whipped, hee striketh a
blow with his hand vppon the table that is before him: then
the executioners doo strike fiue blowes vppon the calues of
the legges of the offender with a broad cane, in the order as
hath beene saide, and is so cruell that none can suffer fiftie of
them but he dieth. The blowe being giuen vppon the table
by the generall, straightwayes one of the proctors maketh a
crie or noise, whereat presently commeth the executioner for
to execute his office. And if the offender dooth deserue
more, then the iudge dooth strike another blowe vppon the
table: then is there giuen him other fiue blowes, and in this
sort dooth the iudge so manie times as his offence dooth
deserue. At the lamentations and shrikes that these miserable
offenders doo giue, the iudges shewe no more signe of
pittie then if they were stroken vppon a stone. So the audience
being concluded and doone with the naturals of the
countrie, the generall commaunded that the Spanyardes
shoulde come a little nearer, and looked and searched their
garments and all the rest, as also their breuiarios and books:
that being done, they were informed by those that brought
them, how and in what order they were apprehended, and
of all other thinges touching their comming into that kingdome:
vnderstanding thereof, he commaunded them to be
carried vnto prison, where they were put in sure holde,
and with great watch and guard for certain dayes, in the
which time they passed incredible trouble, as well of hunger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_277" id="Page_ii_277">[277]</a></span>
as of thirst and heat, which was the occasion that the most
part of them fell sick of agues, and of the laske.<a name="FNanchor_1_77" id="FNanchor_1_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_77" id="Footnote_1_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> From "laxitas", an immoderate looseness of the bowels.</p></div>

<p>So after these dayes that they were in prison, they were
carried once againe to the audience, and many other more
were brought forth to be uisited, all people beleeuing that
the Spaniards should no more returne, but bee executed, for
the which they receiued great content, to be cleared by one
death, of so many as dayly they had before their eyes. In
the conclusion of this audience the generall did decree, that
they should be carried by sea vnto the cittie of Canton,
whereas was the vizroy of that prouince, and he to commande
them to be executed or punished according as hee thought
best, according vnto the penalty put vppon whatsoeuer
straunger that should enter into that kingdome without
licence (as they did enter). But when they saw that they
were carried out of the prison vnto the sea, they verelie
beleeued that it was to drowne them therein; for the which
(having a newe confessed themselues, and commended themselues
vnto God) they did animate one another with the
representation of the reward which was prepared for them:
but when they came vnto the barre whereas they should imbarke
themselues, vppon a suddaine the sea beganne to waxe
verie loftie and troublesome, that it seemed almost a myracle,
and it increased in such sort that the souldiers and mariners
said, that neuer before they had seene the like torment, the
which endured the space of tenne dayes: the which was the
occasion that they did not imbarke themselues, and that the
generall did change his pretence, and determined that they
shoulde be carried by lande vnto the great cittie of Sancheo-Fu,
the which was presently put in vre: they were manie
dayes on this iourney, with fiftie souldiers that did guarde
them: in the which they sawe so manie curious thinges, and
of so great riches, that they iudged it to bee the best countrie
in all the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_278" id="Page_ii_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>So when they came vnto the citty, with no small trouble
and werinesse, by reason of their long iourney and euill intreatings
by the souldiers, they were presently carried (as
might be sayde) from Herode to Pylate, and escaped not one
day, but they were carried to the publike audience, or else
before some particular iudge. This citie was very fresh both
within and without, and full of many orchards, whereas were
an infinite number of fruite, with gardens, stanges of water, and
other thinges of great recreation. This citie is three times
so bigge as Siuell, and compassed about with a mightie
strong wall, their houses are verie great and well wrought,
their streets are exceeding faire, brode and long, and so
straight, that from the one end vnto the other they may see a
man. In equall distance the one from the other, there are
built triumphall arkes (which is an ordinarie and common
thing vsed in the cities of that kingdome): vpon their gates
there are little towers, whereon is planted all the artilerie that
they haue for the defence of the citie (as hath been said),
all the which is inuironed and compassed about with a riuer
which is great and faire, on the which is ordinarily sayling
an infinite number of barkes and brigandines, and is of so
great depth, they may come and lye harde vnto the wall,
yea, ships of great burden. On the one side of the citie
there is a little iland of great recreation, vnto the which
they do passe by a very faire bridge, the one halfe made of
stone and the other of timber, and is of a great length; that
on the part that is made of stone, the father Ignacio did
tell thirtie innes, or victualling houses, whereas was to be
bought, not only flesh and fish, but also great store of marchandice,
of great estimation and valure, as amber, muske,
peeces of silke, and cloth of golde.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_III_XVI" id="CHAP_III_XVI"></a>CHAP. XVI.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spaniardes are sent vnto the citie of Hucheofu, and doo declare
what happened there vnto them.</i></p></div>


<p>From the citie of Sancheofu they were sent vnto Hucheofu,
the which is more principall and greater than the first, alwayes
hauing with them in companie and garde the number of
souldiers aforesaid: sometimes they trauailed by lande and
sometimes by water, whereas they saw so many rich thinges,
which in respect to them, all that they had seene vnto that
time was nothing. Of the which, although I haue had particular
relation of many of them, I leaue off here the declaring
thereof, for that of an itinerario or commentarie I will
not make a historie. But principally for that many of them
doo seeme to be incredible, and will be more vnto those that
haue not had any notice of the mightinesse of this kingdome.</p>

<p>In the discourse of this their iourney, the cities and townes
they sawe were many and verie bigge, and all compassed
with strong walles: and at one of them there was a mightie
riuer, on the which was edified more than five hundreth
engynes or wheeles, and they were made with so much art,
that alonely with the violence of the streame of the riuer
that dooth force them, they water all the groundes there
abouts for the space of two leagues and more, without any
other helpe or humaine force.</p>

<p>In this citie they were certaine daies in visiting and complementes,
after the which they were commaunded to goe
vnto Canton, of the which in the two relations before, is
made particular mention. So when they came vnto the citie
they were carried vnto the prison of the Thequixi, which is
whereas are put such as are condemned to die, the which
they plainely perceiued. There they remayned verie manie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_280" id="Page_ii_280">[280]</a></span>
dayes, and the most part of them were carried vnto the tribunall
seate of the iudges, in companie with others that were
condemned to die.</p>

<p>At this time there was in the citie the Tutan, who was the
viceroye of the prouince, and the Chacu, who is the generall
visitor, and that was at such time as was doone great iustice
for to cleare the prisons, whereas were thousandes of men,
and some that had beene there more than tenne yeares.
There was some day at that time that in the presence of our
people were brought foorth to be iudged, two thousand
prisoners, some to the death, and others to be whipped, and
other to be banished, with other kinde of penalties, according
vnto the disposition and rigor of their lawes. That day
wherein they make capitall audience, they vse particular
ceremonies, as shooting of certaine peeces of artilerie, and to
shut the gates of the citie, not permitting anie to enter in,
neither go foorth, till such time as that act and iustice be
finished, and many other thinges, as hath beene declared in
the first part of this historie.</p>

<p>The Spaniards being in the citie at this time of so great
calamitie, it so fell out that the same time there was a gentleman
of Portingall called Arias Gonsalo de Miranda, chiefe
captaine of the citie of Machao (very deuout vnto religious
men, and a friende vnto Spaniardes), who vnderstanding the
great trouble and danger wherein they were, hee tooke
order by all meanes possible to set them at libertie, and had
so great care therein, that hee went through with his intent,
in such sort that they were deliuered out of pryson, and
from the great feare in which they were, and all by the
intercession of this gentleman, who did vse so good persuasions
for the loue he did beare vnto them, that he made voyde
the euill opinion they had against them, and with compulsion
to reuoke the rigorous sentence of death pronounced against
them. I do not here in particular treate of such thinges as
happened vnto these religious men the servants of God, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_281" id="Page_ii_281">[281]</a></span>
well in the prison as on their iourney, for that they were
many, and to declare them is requisite a long time, and to
make a new historie.</p>

<p>And although in the bookes before, haue been declared
the riches of that kingdome, and all thinges in particular,
yet for the better certification, I thought it good (and not
without purpose) to declare in the chapter following some of
those which the father fryer Martin Ignatio did communicate
with me, vsing in the treating thereof so much breuitie,
that it shall seeme rather an epilogo then a new relation.
And for a more verification of the truth, whereby better
credite may be giuen therevnto, seeing that the persons who
did see it doo agree in that which shall be here declared;
and again, for that the saide father and his companions did
see more thinges than the others, whose relations be alreadie
set downe. The occasion wherefore they put confidence in
them, and to let them see and vnderstand many secretes,
was for that they were sentenced and condemned to die: for
without all doubt if they had vnderstood that they should
haue returned out of the kingdom, they should neuer haue
seene them, for they haue great care that any other nations
should know their secrets, their manner of gouernement, and
liuing.</p>

<p>This kingdome is vnder the tropike of Capricorne, and
stretcheth foorth on the sea coast, south west and north east,
more than fiue hundreth leagues: it hath on the partes south
west the kingdome of Cochinchina, and on the north east, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_282" id="Page_ii_282">[282]</a></span>
dooth confine on Tartaria, a kingdome which dooth compasse
the most part of the lande; on the other part of the northwest
there is an other mightie kingdome of white people,
which is beyonde the kingdome of Persia, it is called Catay:
there be in it Christians, and the king thereof is called
Manuell. It is sayd of a truth, that from the furthest part
<span class="sidenote">Sixe months trauaile from Ierusalem vnto China.</span>
of this kingdome vnto Ierusalem, is sixe moneths trauaile by
lande, the which they vnderstoode by certaine Indians which
came from that kingdome by Persia, whose testimonials were
made in Ierusalem sixe moneths before, wherein was declared
how that they had trauelled by Arabia Felix, and
passed the Red Sea. The other fourth part of this kingdome
is compassed with a verie asper and high mountaine, which
is fiue hundreth leagues vpon a right line: but nature had
left certaine places open towards the northwest, which might
be fourscore leagues, little more or lesse, towards the Sea of
Iapon, which is towards the Septentrion. The great riches
of this countrie, and the great number of people that be
therein, did supplie the same (as in the first part of this
historie is more at large declared). And for that the king of
this countrie seeing himselfe oppressed and troubled by the
mightie Tartaro, and seemed that easily he might defende
himselfe from him, in shutting vp of those gates which
nature had left open betwixt the mountaines, he did shut it
vp with the death of many thousande of people, for that
hee vsed therein great tyrannie, which afterwardes was the
occasion of his owne death.</p>

<p>This mountaine, with the supply by man, is the famous
wall of the kingdom of China, that is of fiue hundred leagues
long; yet you must vnderstande it in the manner aforesaide,
the better to giue credite thereunto, for alonely foure score
leagues were made by mans handes with great industrie,
and there is vpon it an infinite number of bulwarkes, which
maketh it the more fayrer and stronger, but yet not so strong
as is the other four hundreth and twentie leagues which
were made by nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_283" id="Page_ii_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Great ditches and lakes.</span>
Nigh vnto the same there is a great desert full of ditches
and lakes of water, which is the occasion that this kingdome
hath been conserued for more than two thousand yeares, as
doth appeare by their owne histories, which they holde to
bee verie true.</p>

<p>All is imparted into fifteene prouinces, with that of Aynao,<a name="FNanchor_1_78" id="FNanchor_1_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
and euerie one of them hath a principall citie, of the which
it beareth the name. In the middest of this kingdome there
<span class="sidenote">A mightie lake.</span>
is a great lake, out of the which proceedeth many great and
mightie riuers, which runne through all the kingdome, and
are so big that there sayleth vp and downe in them barkes,
fregats, brigandines, and many other vessels of an other
kinde of making. This great abundance of water is the
occasion that it is so fertile, and so well prouided of all
thinges; and againe, the most part of their cities and townes
are situated on the riuers side, so that by them the one prouince
doth communicate with an other, carrying the one
vnto the other great store of marchandice and other thinges
of great curiositie, and is done with little cost, for that all
things are done very good cheape.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_78" id="Footnote_1_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> The island of Hainan.</p></div>

<p>This sea cost of this kingdome is the biggest and the best
that is knowen in all the world; there is vpon it fiue prouinces,
which be these: of Canton, Chincheo, Liampon,
Nanquin, and that of Paquian, which is the furthest towardes
the northwest, in the which is resident the king and his
counsell with all his court ordinarily, and the most part of
the men of warre that it hath, for that this prouince doth
confine vpon the Tartaros their enemies. Some will say,
that the kings ordinarie dwelling there, is for that it is the
best and most fertilest of all the kingdome. But I beleeue
(according to the saying of some of the Chinos) that he doth
it not but because it is so nigh vnto Tartaria, and to finde
himselfe there whereas hee may supply all necessities which
might happen vpon a soddaine by his enimies. In these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_284" id="Page_ii_284">[284]</a></span>
riuers there are certaine ilandes, the which are very profitable
vnto all the kingdome, for that there is nourished and
brought vp in them great store of deare, hogges, and other
beasts, which is the occasion that the cities are so well prouided
and serued.</p>

<p>But one of the things which causeth most admiration to
them that go to this kingdome, is to see so infinite a number
of ships and barkes that be in euerie port thereof, and are so
many, that there hath beene a man in the citie of Machao
that hath layde a wager, that alonely in the riuer of Canton
<span class="sidenote">More ships in one port than in all Spaine.</span>
there be more ships and vessels than in all the cost of
Spaine.</p>

<p>One thing I may affirme, that I haue heard declared by
persons of great credite, that haue beene in that kingdome
(but in especiall of the father Ignacio, whom I do follow in
this Itinerario) that it is an easie thing in any one of these
fiue prouinces that be vpon the sea cost, to ioyne together a
thousande ships of warre, and all of them (as they say in
Spaine) dedicated for that purpose. The occasion why there
be so many, is alreadie declared in his proper chapter.
There are diuers opinions touching the greatnesse of this
kingdome, but the most are conformable with the father
fryer Martin de Herrada, who, like a good geometrician and
mathematician, went nighest the pricke. This opinion is
declared in the first part of this historie whereunto I referre
me, and in that which toucheth in particular things of that
kingdom, for that it is there declared at large as it was taken
out of their bookes. But one thing I cannot let passe but
declare, for that it seemeth woorthie to make thereof a particular
memorie: and I vnderstood it by the mouth of the
said father Ignacio, which is that he doth affirme it to bee
certaine true and approued, that euery day in the yeare one
with an other (besides wars and the plague, the which in
<span class="sidenote">They neuer had the plague.</span>
this countrie they remember not to haue any, neither do they
finde written in their histories for 2,000 yeares, neither by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_285" id="Page_ii_285">[285]</a></span>
famin nor any other accidentall occasions to consume the
people) yet doth there die many thousands of people both
smal and great, in al the fifteen prouinces of this kingdome:
which is no small griefe vnto them, who with a Christian
zeale doth consider this heauie tribute of so many soules that
the diuell doth recouer euerie day, and carrie them vnto his
mansion or dwelling.</p>

<p>All this kingdome is so fertile, as well for the ordinarie
watring as also for the temperature of the heauen, that almost
all the whole yeare they do gather fruits, but in especiall of
wheat and rice: so that both the one and the other are very
good cheape, that our people in the discourse of their trauaile
or pilgrymage did buy one pyco of rice or of wheate
meale, which is fiue roues of Spaine, for one ryall and a halfe;
and according vnto this rate al other thinges beare their
prices, as hath beene before declared. They say that in this
countrie there be many elephants, lyons, tygres, ownses, and
other brute beastes, of the which these fryers sawe verie few
aliue, but manie skins of them, which is a signe that it is of
truth. There are many beasts whereof come the muske, the
which are of the tygres, and like vnto a litle dogge, the
which they do kill and put them vnder the ground certaine
dayes, and after that it is putrified and rotten, the flesh and
bloud is conuerted into that sweete powder. There be also
many cyuet cats and little worth, a great number of horse,
and although those which the said friers did see were litle,
yet is it a common voice and fame that in some of the fifteene
prouinces there are very good: but they were not there, so
that they cannot say they had seene them. But the hens,
geese, duckes, and other poultrie that are in all partes of this
kingdome are without number, which is the occasion that
they are of small estimation: the abundance of fish is no
lesse, as well of the sea as of the riuers, in the which they
are conformable. All they that do declare of the thinges of
this countrie, and the small price that it is solde for, is such,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_286" id="Page_ii_286">[286]</a></span>
that the saide frier doth affirme, and others that haue bin in
that kingdome, that for the value of sixe marauadies (which
is a pennie) may four companions eat very wel of flesh, fish,
rice, and fruits, and drinke good wine of that countrie.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mynes of golde and siluer.</span>
In all this kingdome there are many mynes both of gold and
siluer, and all verie rich: but the king will not let them be
labored but with great lymitation (saying) that which is in
those mynes be in his house, and that they should procure
to bring it from other kingdomes: yet notwithstanding the
abundance is so great both of the one and the other, and so
common, that there is no man, although he be of an occupation,
but hee hath in his house things both of gold and siluer,
<span class="sidenote">Siluer for his value more
esteemed than gold.</span>
and other very rich iewels. They do esteeme for his value
more the siluer than the golde: and they say the cause is,
for that the prices of golde are variable, as in Italie: but the
siluer is alwaies at one staye and price.</p>

<p>There are great store of pearles, but in especiall in the
Iland of Aynao; and great abundance of quicksiluer, copper,
yron, steele, laton,<a name="FNanchor_1_79" id="FNanchor_1_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> tyn, lead, salt peter, brimstone, and
other things which were woont to beautifie a kingdome, but
<span class="sidenote">Amber gryce.</span>
aboue all, there is very much muske and amber gryce.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_79" id="Footnote_1_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> Latten, iron covered with tin.</p></div>

<p>The king of this kingdome, besides the great rent the which
he hath, it is saide that he hath great treasories in all the principall
cities, those which are the head cities of the prouinces;
for the confirmance thereof, it was affirmed vnto the saide
fryer for a verie certaintie, that in the citie of Canton, all
<span class="sidenote">Wonderfull treasure.</span>
the money that hath entred into the same for the space of
fiue hundred yeres (as well by way of the Portingals, as by
those of the kingdom of Cyan,<a name="FNanchor_2_80" id="FNanchor_2_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and others their borderers,
and all the tributes of that prouince) is altogether in the
king's treasure house of that citie, which amounteth vnto, by
good account, many more millions than may be well numbred
for to giue credite thereunto. It is as common for the
people of this countrie to weare silke, as in Europe to weare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_287" id="Page_ii_287">[287]</a></span>
lynnen; yea, they doo make their shooes thereof, some of
satten, and many times of cloth of golde, of verie gallant
colours: the cause is by reason of the great abundance that
they haue thereof, and is of so great quantitie, that it is carried
from the citie of Canton vnto the Portingall Indians
more than three thousand kintals euery yeare, besides a great
quantitie which is carried vnto Japon, and ordinarily more
than fifteene ships laden for the Ilandes of Luzon. The
Sianes, and other nations, doo also carrie away a great quantitie:
and although there are carried away ordinarily as afore
<span class="sidenote">Fleetes may be laden with silke.</span>
saide, yet there remaineth so great quantity in that kingdome,
that many fleetes may be laden therewith.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_80" id="Footnote_2_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> Siam.</p></div>

<p>There is also great store of flax, cotton, and other kinde
of webstrie,<a name="FNanchor_3_81" id="FNanchor_3_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and al so good cheape that the aforesaide fryer
dooth affirme that he hath seene solde a canger,<a name="FNanchor_4_82" id="FNanchor_4_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> which is
fifteene fadom, for foure ryals of plate. The fine earthen
dishes that are in this countrie, cannot be declared without
many wordes. But that which is brought from thence into
Spaine is verie course; although, vnto them that hath not
seene the finer sort, it seemeth excellent good: but they
haue such with them, that a cubbard thereof amongest vs
would be esteemed as though it were of golde. The finest
cannot be brought foorth of the kingdome vpon paine of
death; neyther can any haue the vse thereof, but onely the
loytias, which be there gentlemen (as hath been tolde you).
<span class="sidenote">Sugar, hony, and waxe.</span>
There is great quantitie of sugar, honie, and waxe, and verie
good cheape as aforesaide. And in conclusion I say, that
they liue with so great abundance, that all things do flow so
that they lacke nothing necessarie for their bodies: but for
their soules, which is the principallest, they do lack (as you
haue vnderstoode in the discourse of this historie): God
remedie the same at his pleasure.</p>

<p>The rent which the king of this kingdome hath, is declared
vnto you in a proper chapter of it selfe; so that in this I
will declare that which the sayde fryer tolde me, and is onely
<span class="sidenote">A riuer that yeeldeth a million and
a halfe euery yeare in salt.</span>
of one riuer, which is called the riuer of the salt, and is
in the prouince of Canton, and is worth vnto him, euerie
yeare, a million and a halfe. And although the ordinarie
rent, the which he hath euerie yeare, dooth exceede the
greatest king that is nowe knowen in all the world in quantitie;
yet, in his treasories which he gathered together and
kept (if it be true that the Chinos do say), in euery principall
citie of these fifteene prouinces, is more than a great number
of kings togither haue or can procure, no, nor come nigh
vnto it by a great deale.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">All cities are walled.</span>
All the cities and townes of this kingdome are walled
about with stone walles, and at euerie fifteene paces a bulwarke;
and without the wall commonly all of them haue a
riuer, or else a great deepe moote, wherein they may bring
water at all times, with the which they are very strong:
they doo vse no fortes, neyther haue they any, but onely
ouer the gates of the cities, towers (as hath been declared),
and in them is put all the artilerie, the which is for the
defence of that citie or towne.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">They vse hargabushes, bowes, and lances.</span>
They vse many sortes of weapons, but in especiall hargabushes,
bowes, lances of three or foure manners, swords like
vnto faunchers, and with them targets. All the souldiers
when they go to fight, they weare long garments down to
their knees, very wel stuffed with cotton wooll, the which
doth resist the thrust of a lance, or a stabbe: all such souldiers
as haue the king's ryall pay weare, in token thereof,
red and yellowe hats, of the which there is so great a number,
as well horsemen as foot men, that almost it is impossible to
<span class="sidenote">Englande, France, Spaine, and
the Turke hath not so many souldiers as this kingdome.</span>
number them. And it is a common opinion of all them that
haue bin in this kingdome, and haue seene them, that all
Spaine, France, and the Great Turke, hath not so many as
this kingdome hath. They haue amongst them captaines of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_289" id="Page_ii_289">[289]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Captaines of few and many souldiers.</span>
ten souldiers, some of a hundreth souldiers, some of a thousand,
of ten thousand, of twentie thousand, and in this sort
to a hundred thousand. The number of souldiors that these
captains do leade, are knowen by certain ensignes that they
beare. They muster and make show of their people euery
new moone; and the same day they do pay them royally,
and their pay must be in siluer, and in no other money. It
is saide by such as have seene this pay, but especially the
aforesaid father, Fryer Ignacio, that they giue them a peece
of siluer, which may weigh so much as a ryall and halfe of
Spaine, and is as much worth there as foure crownes amongest
vs, in respect of the value of all things. But both in the
one and in the other kingdom, that day that they do receiue
their pay, euery one must make a show of some act in armes,
the which is done in the presence of viewers or muster-masters:
and such as are found that doo not his exercise
with dexteritie, they are reprehended and cruelly punished:
they doo skirmish with great consort, and in that which
toucheth obedience to their captaines, and vnto the ensignes,
the which they do vse in their wars, they may compare with
all nations of the world.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_III_XVIII" id="CHAP_III_XVIII"></a>CHAP. XVIII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>This Chapter doth treat of certaine rites and ceremonies, and other signes
and tokens which be found, and do show that they haue had notice of
the holy law of the Gospel.</i></p></div>


<p>Such ceremonies as vnto this day haue bin seene amongst
the people of this kingdom, are gentilicas,<a name="FNanchor_1_83" id="FNanchor_1_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> without any mixture
with the Moores, nor with any other sect: yet there is
found amongst them, that is a sufficient indition,<a name="FNanchor_2_84" id="FNanchor_2_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> that they
haue had in some time past, some particular notice of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_290" id="Page_ii_290">[290]</a></span>
euangelical law, as is plainly seene by certaine pictures which
haue beene found and seene amongest them, whereof we
haue made particular mention, the which they beleeue was
knowen by the preaching of the Apostle S. Thomas, who
passed through this kingdome when as he went vnto the
Indians, and from thence to the city of Salamina,<a name="FNanchor_3_85" id="FNanchor_3_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> which,
<span class="sidenote">Salamina where S. Thomas was martred.</span>
in their language, is called Malipur, whereas he was martyred
for the name and faith of Jesus Christ: of whom, at
this day, they do remember in that kingdome, by the tradition
of their antecessors, who said, that many yeares past
there was in that kingdome a man that did preach vnto them
a new law, whereby they might goe vnto heauen: who, after
that hee had preached certaine daies, and saw little fruit
thereof (for that they were all occupied in ciuill wars) he
departed from thence vnto the Indians. But first he left
certaine disciples behind him that were baptised and well
instructed in matters of faith, that they might preach vnto
them whenas occasion did serue for the same. In many
places they do worship the diuell, only for that he should do
them no harme; and so the said fryer did tell me, for that
hee was diuers times in presence whereas they did obsequies
of certaine Chinos that lay a dying: and he saw that they
had painted before the dead man a furious diuell, having in
his left hand the sunne, and in his right hand a dagger, with
the which he made a show as though he would strike him.
This picture was put before him at the point that hee should
yeelde vp the ghost, strengthening him that he should put
great trust thereon.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_83" id="Footnote_1_83"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> The original Spanish word, meaning "pagan", left untranslated.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_84" id="Footnote_2_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> From the Spanish <i>indicio</i>, "proof".</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_85" id="Footnote_3_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> More properly Calamina. Tillemont upon this subject says: "Les
Portugais pretendent qu'il y a une ancienne inscription à Maliapur dans
les Indes, où l'on apprend entre autres choses que Saint Thomas fut percé
d'une lance au pié d'une croix près de cette ville. C'est peutêtre ce qui
fait dire aux auteurs nouveaux que Calamine est la même ville que
Maliapur."</p></div>

<p>And as the fryer did demand of them what reason they
had to do the same, some of them answered and saide, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_291" id="Page_ii_291">[291]</a></span>
the diuell should do no harme vnto the dead man in
the other world they put his picture before him, that he
might knowe him, and take him for his friend.</p>

<p>That which is vnderstood of these Chinos is, that although
they haue amongst them many errors of the Gentiles; yet
with great ease they would be reduced vnto our faith, if
they might haue libertie for to preach, and they to receiue it.</p>

<p>When as the sunne and the moone is in eclypse, they beleeue
verily that the prince of the heauen will destroye them,
and for verye feare they put them selues in that colour: the
people generally doo worshippe vnto them, and beleeue
verily that the sunne is a man, and the moone a woman.
And therefore, when as they beginne to bee eclypsed, they
make great sacrifices and inuocations unto the prince afore
said, desiring him not to kill nor destroy them, for the great
necessitie they haue of them. All generally beleeue the immortalitie
of the soule; and that in the other world they
shall be rewarded or punished according as they liued in this
worlde, in company of the bodie. And therefore they do
vse to make in the fields sepulchres, wherein they command
themselues to be buried after they bee dead. When they
should be buried, they command to kill all their seruants or
their wiues, those that best he loued in his life, saying, that
they do it that they should go with them to serue them in
the other world, whereas they beleeue they shall liue eternally
and die no more. They put with them into their
sepulchres things to be eaten and great riches, beleeuing
that they do carry the same into the other world, and there
to serue their necessities. In this error were the Indians of
the Peru of old antiquity, as the Spaniards haue seene by
experience. There is in this kingdom many vniuersities and
colleges, wherein is taught philosophie, both naturall and
morall, and the lawes of the countrie, for to learne to gouerne
by them; vnto the which the king doth send ordinarily
visitors to see and vnderstand the order that is amongst them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_292" id="Page_ii_292">[292]</a></span>
and to reward or punish the students according vnto the
desert of eyther of them. They are greatly ashamed when
they see any euil thing committed, although they bee not
punished for the same, and are people that do permit with
ease correction, as the father Ignacio and his companions did
see by experience; who going alwayes as condemned men
to die, yet at all times when they did see them do reuerence
vnto their idols or vnto the diuell, or any other euill thing,
they did reprehend them with great liberty, who did not
onely seeke to hurt them for the same, but did greatly reioyce
to heare their reasons wherewith they did prohibite or forbid
them. The said frier did tell me that, one day, passing by
an hermitage, whereas dwelled an hermite who had, vpon the
altar in the same, an idoll for his saint: before whom was
there a Chino, a principall man, worshipping the same; the
saide father, without any feare, went vnto him, and began to
reprehende him, and to spit at the idoll, and caused him
therewith to leaue off his worshipping, whereof he was
greatly amazed, both he and all the rest of his companie, to
see with what boldnes it was done, and no harme done vnto
him for the same, eyther they supposed that the Chino did
thinke him to be a mad man, or else (which is most to be
beleeued) that God did worke with his seruant whereby he
would giue him his reward for that which he had done, in
returning for his honour, in mittigating the furie of that man,
and to giue him vnderstanding that he was reprehended with
reason. There are many Chinos conuerted to the faith as
well in the Ilands Philippinas, as in the citie of Machao, and
they baptise of them daily, who giue tokens and outwarde
showes to bee good Christians, and say that the greatest difficultie
for to conuert all the whole kingdome, will be in
them that doo gouerne in the same, for they had neede of a
particular ayde and helpe of the mercie of God to bring
them vnto the faith; for that they are had in reuerence and
obeyed as Gods vpon the earth. Besides this, they do giue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_293" id="Page_ii_293">[293]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Giuen to delights.</span>
themselues to all delightes that any humaine creature can
imagine, for that they put all their felicitie therein, and doo
it with so great extremitie, that it is supposed there is no
people in all the worlde that may be compared vnto them.</p>

<p>For besides that they are alwayes carried in little chayres,
and vpon mens shoulders, which are covered with silke and
golde; yet are they giuen much vnto bankets, wherein they
haue so many different sortes of meates as their appetites
doo require. And it is greatly to be maruailed at, that the
<span class="sidenote">Their women are chast, but their men
are vicious.</span>
women of this kingdome are marveilous chast and secret as
any whatsoeuer; and to the contrarie the men are as vicious,
but in especiall the lords and gouernors: and for that our
faith do reprehend with rigor and terror the excesse of these
thinges, it is to be beleeued that it will be a great impediment
to the entrie of the Gospel amongst them: yet God may so
touch them, and in such sort, that there will be no difficultie.
Amongest the common people there will be no such impediment;
but rather they will embrace with great content our
holy law, for that it will be an occasion to cleare and set
them at libertie from the tyrannie of the diuell, and from
their iudges and lords, who do intreate them as slaues. This
is the opinion of all them that haue entred into this kingdome,
and haue intreated of this matter with the Chinos.
They haue amongest them some good thinges, and woorthie
to be imitated and folowed, of the which I will here set
downe two, which are thinges of great purpose to my iudgement.
The one is, that vnto none they do giue the office to
gouerne, by no manner of wayes nor meanes, although they
be suborned by friendship, but onely by his owne merites
and sufficient abilitie. The seconde, that none can be viceroy,
gouernours, nor iudge of a prouince or citie, in the
which hee is naturall borne, the which they say is done to
take away the occasion of dooing any iniustice, beeing carried
away or led by parentes or friendshippe. All other thinges
of this kingdome I do remit vnto that which hath bin before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_294" id="Page_ii_294">[294]</a></span>
declared, for to passe vnto the rest, the which in this Itinerario
is promised to be mentioned and declared.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAP_III_XIX" id="CHAP_III_XIX"></a>CHAP. XIX.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>This Chapter doth treate of the Islands of Japon, and of other thinges in
that kingdome.</i></p></div>


<p>The Ilands of Japon are many, and altogether make a
<span class="sidenote">Iapon is 300 leagues from China.</span>
mightie kingdome, that is divided amongest many lords: it
is distant from the firme land of China, three hundred
leagues, and in the middest betwixt both kingdoms is the
prouince of Lanquin, which is one of the fifteene afore
named; although going from Machao, a city of the Portingals,
and ioyning vnto Canton, which is of the Proper China,
they do make it but two hundred and fiftie leagues, trauelling
towards the north, and commonly they do account the same
leagues from the Ilands of Luzon or Philippinas, vnto the
said Ilands of Japon: whereunto they may go by Noua
Hispania, for that it is better and surer nauigation, and
shorter voyage, for according vnto the reckoning of the
pylots that do nauigate those seas, they make it no more then
1750 leagues, which is not halfe of that which the Portingalls
make in their nauigation.</p>

<p>These ilands are many (as aforesaid), yet are they populared
with much people, who in their bodies and faces differ
very little from the Chinos, although not so politike: [by the
which it seemed to be true, that which is found written in the
histories of the kingdom of China, saying, that these Japones
in old time were Chinas, and that they came from that
mightie kingdome vnto these ilands, whereas they do now
dwell, for this occasion following. A kinsman of a king of
China, a man of great countenance and valour, hauing conceiued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_295" id="Page_ii_295">[295]</a></span>
within his brest for to kill the king, and thereby to
make himselfe lorde of the countrie, the better to put this in
execution, he gaue to vnderstand of his euill intent vnto
others of his friends, requesting their fauour to execute the
same, promising that he would do his best. This being
done, and hauing them alwaies for his especiall friends, unto
whom it seemed no difficult thing, and againe moued with
ambition, they did promise him: and for the better confirmation
thereof, they began to prepare souldiers, and to haue
them readie against the day appointed. And for that this
their pretence could not be brought to effect with such
secrecie as the matter required, their treason came to be discouered
vnto the king, at such good oportunitie that he
might very well seeke remedie for his owne safegard at his
pleasure, vnlooked for of his kinsman and the rest of his
followers, who were all taken with great ease.</p>

<p>Then was it determined by those of the royall councell,
that all the traitors should haue their throts cut according
vnto the lawes of the countrie: but when their sentence was
carried vnto the king to be confirmed (he vnderstanding that
they much repented, and were sorie for their sin and treason
that they had pretended against him), he determined to remedie
the same with less damage, fearing what might happen
by their deaths, so that he comanded they should not die,
<span class="sidenote">The first inhabiting of the Iapon.</span>
but be banished for euer out of the kingdome, with precise
band, that they, their wiues and children, and al that should
come of them, should for euer liue on those ilands that are
now called Iapon, which were at that time desert and without
people. This sentence was executed, and the offenders
did accept the same for mercie. So they were caried to the
said ilands, wheras when they saw themselues out of their
naturall countrie, and without any possibility euer to returne
againe, they ordained their comon wealth as a thing to last
for euer: directing all their lawes which were for their conseruation
and gouernment, contrarie vnto the Chinos from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_296" id="Page_ii_296">[296]</a></span>
whence they came. But in particular they made one, wherin
they did prohibite for euer their descendants to haue any
frindship with the Chinos, and did admonish them to do
them all the euill that was possible, which is obserued and
kept vnto this day inuiolable, shewing themselues their contraries
in all they may, euen in their apparell, speech, and
customes: for the which there is no nation so abhorred of
the Chinos as is the Iapones, so that they are payd their
hatred with the like. And although at that time the said
Iapones were subiectes and tributaries vnto the king of
China, and so continued long time after, now at this day
they are not, but do all harme that may be vnto those of that
kingdome.]<a name="FNanchor_1_86" id="FNanchor_1_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>They haue much siluer, but not so fine as that is of our
Indians, likewise great abundance of rice and flesh, and in
some parts wheate: and although they haue all this, with
many fruits, and hearbs, and other things which be their
ordinary victuals, yet are they not so well prouided as are
their confines or neighbors, and no default in the lande, for
that it is verie good and fruitefull. But that the naturall
people do giue themselues verie little vnto the tilling and
sowing thereof, for that they are more affectioned vnto the
warres then vnto that: and this is the reason that many times
they do lack prouision and victuals, which is the verie same
reason that the naturall people and others do report of them.
<span class="sidenote">In the Iapones are 66 kingdomes.</span>
There be in these ilandes three score and sixe kingdoms or
prouinces, and many kings, although it may be better said,
rulers or principals, such as the Spaniardes found in the
Ilands of Luzo: for which cause, although they be called
kings, yet are they not, neither in their contractation nor rent,
for they haue verie little in respect of the multitude of
people. The king Nobunanga, who died in the yeare 1583,
was the most principall and greatest lord amongst them all,
as well of people as of riches: who was slaine by a captaine
of his, and punished by God by this meanes for his luciferine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_297" id="Page_ii_297">[297]</a></span>
pride, for that it did farre exceede that of Nebuchadonozor,
and was come vnto that point that he would haue beene worshipped
for a god: for the which he commanded to make a
sumptuous temple, and to put in it thinges that did well
declare and showe his follie: of the which that you may see
how farre it did extend, I will declare here onely that which
he did promise vnto them that did visite his temple.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A luciferine pride.</span>
First, the rich men that came vnto the saide temple, and
did worshippe his picture, should be more richer: and those
that were poore, should obtaine great riches: and both the
one and the other, that had no successors to inherite their
goods, should also obtaine them, and also long life for to
enioy the same, with great peace and quietnesse.</p>

<p>The second, that their life should be prolonged to eighty
yeares.</p>

<p>The third, that they should bee hole of all their infirmities
and diseases, and shall obtaine full accomplishment of
all their desires with health and tranquillitie. And the last
he commanded that euery month they should celebrate a
feast for his birth day, and therein to visite his temple, with
certification that all those that did beleeue in him, and in that
which hee promised, should without all doubt see it accomplished,
and those which in this life were faultie and did not
doo in effect his commaundement, in the other they should
goe the way to perdition. And the better to accomplish this
his will, he commaunded to be put in this temple, al the idols
in his kingdomes that were most worshipped, such as to
whom frequented most pilgrimes: the which being done, he
presently forbad that not one of them all should be worshipped,
but he onely that was the true Fotoque and vniuersall
god, the author and creator of nature.</p>

<p>[This foolishnesse did this proud king a little before his
miserable death, and many other more, that I do leaue out,
for feare that I should be too tedious in this itinerario.
There did succeed this proude king in the kingdome his sonne,

<p>All men that are borne in this land are naturally inclined
to warres and robberies, and it is vsed ordinarily amongst
themselues, alwayes he that hath most power and strength doth
carry away the best part; and yet he doth enioy it with little
securitie, for that as the prouerbe saith "he findeth a last for
his shoo, or the length of his foote is found," and another
commeth (when he thinketh least off) and carrieth away
their spoile with victorie, reuenging iniuries the one for the
other, without being requested thereunto: which is the occasion
that they are neuer without ciuill warres, and that
seemeth to bee the influence of the clime of that land. This,
and the continual exercise in armes and in robberies, hath
giuen them the name of warriers, and do terrifie all their
borderers and neighbors.</p>

<p>They vse many weapons, but especially hargabusses,
swords, and lances, and are very expert in them. On the
firme land of China they haue done many suddaine robberies
and thefts, and haue gone thorough therewith at their pleasure:
and would haue done the like at the Ilands of Luzon,
and vsed for the same all meanes possible, but yet it fell out
contrary vnto their meanings, and returned their backes
full euill against their wils, with their hands vpon their
owne heads.</p>

<p>On a time they came vnto the Illocos, who with the fauour
of the Spaniards (whose vassals they are) did defende themselues
worthily: that the Iapones thought it best to returne
vnto their houses and to leaue their begun pretence, with
determination neuer to put themselues in the like perill, for
that they had lost many of their companie. Not many
yeares since there happened vnto them the like disgrace in
China: there went tenne thousande of them to robbe and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_299" id="Page_ii_299">[299]</a></span>
steale, and at their going on lande, they did sacke a cittie
with little hurt and smal resistance, who with the content of
that pray, forgot themselues and did not preuent the harme
that might chance vnto them: the Chinos being offended
did compasse them about in such sort, that when the Iapones
remembred themselues, they were in that case that they
were constrained to yielde vnto their enimies, who at their
willes did repay themselues very well of the iniurie receiued,
and a very good warning vnto all those that shall heare
thereof, to flie from putting themselues into the like trance:
so the Chinos were very wel reuenged of the iniury by them
receiued.</p>

<p>The faith of Christ is very well planted in some of these
ilands, by the good diligence and trauell of the fathers and
Iesuites, but in particular by that which was doone by
Master Francisco Xabier, one of the tenne companions of the
father Ignacio de Loyola, a founder of the saide religion:
hee trauelled with great zeale in the conuerting of the saide
Ilands, and that which was a great helpe vnto the same was
his holy doctrine and apostolike life, as vnto this day the
Iapones doo confesse, attributing vnto him (next vnto God)
the goodnesse that hath come vnto them by receiuing the
baptisme, whome the fathers of that companie haue followed
in all pointes, such as remained after his death, as also such
as haue gone thither since that time.</p>

<p>So that vnto them may be attributed the thankes for the
mollifying of such adamantine hearts, as are those of the
natural people of these ilandes, whose wittes (although they
be good and subtil) are naturally knowne to be inclined
vnto warres, robberies, and doing of euill: and at this day,
being Christians, they do followe their euill inclinations, yet
notwithstanding, by the good doctrine and ensample of the
saide fathers, they are much better Christians then those of
the Orientall or East Indians.</p>

<p>I do not set downe here the number of those that are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_300" id="Page_ii_300">[300]</a></span>
baptised in these ilands, for that there are therein diuers
opinions, as also for that the fathers of the name of Iesus or
Iesuits doo distinctly declare in their letters. The Portugals
say that in respect of the number of people that are to bee
conuerted, the number that are baptised are very fewe, and
that there are many that are not, for lacke of ministers and
preachers; the which may easily be remedied, in commaunding
to go thither more religious men of other orders, for to
aide and helpe the saide Iesuites, the which shoulde be vnto
them a particular content and comfort as I doo beleeue, as
hath beene seene by experience in all partes of the Indians,
whereas haue come religious men vnto places of their doctrine,
for that the quantitie of people is so great that are in
these ilandes, that although there shoulde go thither many
laborers of the gospell, and all the orders of religious men,
the one should not be a let or hindrance vnto the other, and
they shoulde all of them finde enough to occupie themselues,
especially if that the successor of Nobunanga were conuerted
with his subjectes. All the men of these ilands are well set
and well proportioned, and go well apparelled, although not
in so good order as those of China: they liue verie healthfully
and long, by reason that they doo vse verie few diuersities
of meates: they doo not suffer amongst them any
phisitians, and doo not cure themselues but with simples.</p>

<p>They haue amongst them many priests of their idols, whom
they do call Bonsos, of the which there be great couents.
<span class="sidenote">Many witches.</span>
Likewise they haue amongst them great witches, who do
ordinarily talke with the diuell, and are not a small impediment
for them to receiue the lawe of God in that kingdome.
The women or wiues of these Iapones do keepe themselues
very close, and very seldome go forth of their houses, in the
which they do resemble those of China much (as hath beene
said), yet haue they many wiues, for that by their lawes it is
lawfull for them to haue as they please and can sustaine;
yet are they so prudent, that they do restraine themselues,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_301" id="Page_ii_301">[301]</a></span>
and liue in great peace. Both men-seruants and women-seruants
do serue their masters, as though they were slaues,
and they may kill them at their pleasure without incurring
any penalty of their lawes, a thing far different from any
good policie. Many other things more could I declare of
this kingdome, the which I do let passe, for the reason aforesaid:
and again, for that the fathers of the company of Iesus
haue intreated thereof at large and vere truely.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ilands of Amazones.</span>
Not farre from these Ilands of Iapon, they haue discouered
of late certaine ilandes which are called of the Amazones, for
that they are all inhabited by women, whose ordinary weapons
are bowes and arrowes, and are very expert in the same:
they haue their right brest drie, the better to exercise their
bow. Unto these ilands, in certaine monethes euery yeare,
goeth certaine shippes from Iapones with merchandice, and
they bring from thence such as they haue there: in the
which time the men do deale with the Amazones as with
their own proper wiues, and for to auoide dangers that might
happen amongst themselues they deale in this order following.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A strange custome.</span>
After that their shippes are aryued, there goeth on shore
two messengers for to giue aduice vnto the queene of their
arriuall, and of the number of men that are in their shippes,
who dooth appoint a day when they shall all come on shoare:
the which day shee doth carrie to the waters side the like number
of women, as they bee of men, but the saide women doo first
come thither before the men doo disembarke themselues, and
euery one of them dooth carry in their hande a paire of shooes,
or a paire of slippers, and on them their own seuerall marke,
and do leaue them on the sands at the waters side, without any
consort or order, and presently departe from thence. Then
the men come on shoare, and euery one take the first paire
of shooes that he commeth vnto, and put them on: then presently
the women come forth, and euery one of them carryeth
with her him who hath fallen vnto her by lot, to put on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_302" id="Page_ii_302">[302]</a></span>
her shoes, and maketh him her guest, without any other
particularitie, although it chanceth unto the most vilest of
them all to meete with the queenes shooes, or otherwise to
the contrarie.</p>

<p>So when the monethes are expired set downe by the
queene, in the which are permitted the men aforesaid, they
doo depart, euerie one leauing with his hostis his name, and
the towne where hee dwelleth, for that if it so fall out that
they bee with child, and be deliuered of a sonne, that hee
may bee carried the yeare following vnto his father, but the
daughters do remaine with them.</p>

<p>This is very doubtfull to bee beleeued, although I haue
bin certified by religious men, that haue talked with persons
that within these two yeares haue beene at the saide ilands,
and haue seene the said women; and that which causeth me
more to stand in doubt, is for that the fathers of the companie
that dwell at the Iapones, haue not in their letters
made any particular mention of them: therefore let euery
one giue credite to this as liketh him best.</p>

<p>From the cittie of Machao, which is inhabited by Portugals,
and situated on the skirt of the firme lande of China, in
two and twentie degrees, the aforesaide father Ignacio did
trauell for Malaca, passing by the gulfe of Aynao, which is
an ilande and prouince of China, and fiue leagues from the
firme lande, and from the Philippinas one hundreth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_303" id="Page_ii_303">[303]</a></span>
foure score. It is a very rich prouince and of great prouision,
and in the straight that is betwixt them and the firme
<span class="sidenote">Great fishing of pearles.</span>
lande, there is great fishing of pearles and aliafar,<a name="FNanchor_1_88" id="FNanchor_1_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and those
which are there founde do in many killats<a name="FNanchor_2_89" id="FNanchor_2_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> exceede them
that are brought from Baren, which is on the coast of Arabia,
or those that are brought from Manar, which is another kingdome
from whence is brought many vnto that of China.</p>

<p>This prouince of Aynao is very good and strong, and the
people thereof very docible and well inclined. From this
ilande to the kingdome of Cochinchina, is fiue and twenty
leagues, and from Machao, one hundreth and twentie fiue:
it is a mightie kingdome, and is in sixteene degrees of altitude,
and the one part therof is ioyned with the firme land of China.
The whole is deuided into three prouinces. The first dooth
enter forty leagues into the lande, and hath in it a mightie king.
The second is more farther within the land, and he that is
lord thereof is a king of greater power than the first; and
ioyning vnto the sun, more towards the Septentrion, is the
thirde, the which is more greater and of more riches, whose
king in respect of the other two is an emperor, and is called
in their language Tunquin, which doth signifie the same.
Unto him be subiect the other two kings: yet notwithstanding
his mightinesse, and called emperour, hee is subiect vnto

has grown the name of lignum aquilæ, whence the genus of this plant
now receives a botanic appellation, and which many authors have vainly
attempted to distinguish from the lignum aloes and Calambac. The
latter is a Malay name of the aloe wood, derived, according to the conjecture
of Rumphius, from the Chinese Kilam."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Aboundance of silke and gold.</span>
Great aboundance of silke and gold, and of other things
very curious: all these kingdomes are at a very point to be
reduced vnto our faith, for that the principall (he whom
they giue title of emperor) hath sent diuers times to Machao,
and vnto other parts whereas are Christians, and haue requested
to send them persons both learned and religious,
for to instruct them in the law of God, for that they are all
determined to receiue it and be baptised: and doo desire it
with so great feruentnesse, that in manie citties they haue
the timber ready to build and edifie churches, and in a redinesse
all other kind of necessaries for the same.</p>

<p>There was in Machao a religious man of the order of barefoote
friars of S. Francis, who, vnderstanding the great and
good desire of this king, did sende him by certaine Portugal
merchants that did trade into his countrie, a cloth whereon
was painted the day of iudgement and hell, and that by an excellent
workeman; and also a letter, wherein hee did signifie
vnto him the great desire he had with some other of his companions
to go into his kingdome to preach the gospel. The
which being receiued by the said king, and informed the signification
of the picture, and of the religious man that sent
it him, he reioyced very much with the present; and did
send in returne of the same an other that was very good,
vnto the same religious man, and a letter of great curtesie,
and did accept the offer that hee sent in his letter, and did
promise that all that went thither shoulde haue good entertainement,
and that he would presently make them a house
next vnto his.</p>

<p>This religious man, although he had a desire to put in
execution the kings will, yet at that time hee coulde not, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_305" id="Page_ii_305">[305]</a></span>
reason that he had but few companions: the which the king
did vnderstande, and caused him to sende vnto the bishoppe
of Machao three or foure letters, requesting him to send him
the saide religious men, with certification that hauing them
there, both hee and all the rest of his kingdome woulde receiue
the faith of Christ and the holy baptisme: vnto the
which letters they did alwaies make answere with promises
that he would send them vnto him: but after, because they
did not accomplish the same, the king did complaine of him
vnto certaine Portugall merchants with great griefe, saying,
this your bishop of Machao doth greatly lye; for that I haue
requested him by foure letters to send me religious men for to
preach the law of the gospell, and he consenting vnto my
wil, did neuer accomplish nor performe his word. Unto this
day they haue not accomplished this desire, for the great lacke
they haue of such ministers as they doo demande, and are
requisite in those parts, and cannot supply their want and
necessitie, except they should leaue them vnprouided that
bee already baptised. They doo driue them off with faire
words and promises, that with as great breuitie as is possible,
their desire shal be satisfied. And this was the answere that
was giuen in Machao vnto certaine messengers or ambassadors
that were sent by the aforesaid king, for the same demand,
the which was required with great instance. The
which messengers for their comfort, and for his who sent
them, did carry with them al such images as they might
haue, but specially that of the crosse, in which form and
likenes (as hath bin informed) they haue made in the kingdome
an infinite number, and set them in all their streets,
highwayes, and houses, whereas they are worshiped and reuerenced
with great humilitie, as well for that it is in an
ensigne of Christ, whose faith they do desire to receiue, as
also for a notable miracle which happened in that kingdome
worthy to make thereof a particular mention, the which I
will set downe here, in such sort as the ambassadors aforesaide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_306" id="Page_ii_306">[306]</a></span>
did declare in publike before the inhabitants of Machao,
when as they came to demande religious men for to
instruct them in the gospel.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A myracle.</span>
There was a man naturally borne in this kingdome, who,
for certaine occasions went forth of the same, and came and
dwelt amongst the Portugals, who, seeing the Christian ceremonies,
and being touched with the hand of God, was baptised,
and remained certain yeares in the same towne, giuing
outwarde shewes to bee a good Christian, and one that feared
God; at the end thereof he changed his minde, and determined
to returne vnto his owne countrie, and there to liue
according vnto that which he had learned of the Christians,
the which he beleeued to doo with ease, without any gaine-saying
or contradiction. Whereas when hee came thither,
hee did obserue all such things as a Christian was bounde to
doo: but amongst other signes and tokens of the same, he
made a crosse and set it by the door of his house, whereunto
he did reuerence at all times, when he passed by the same,
with great devotion. His neighbours when as they saw that
signe, a thing of them neuer seene before, and howe that
that Christian did make particular reuerence, they beganne
to mocke and scorne him and the crosse, and pulled it downe
from the place whereas it was set, and did other things in
dispite thereof, and of him that had set it there in that place,
whose hatred and discourtesie was so much that they determined
in their minds to burne it, and to put the same in
execution, who, at the same instance, did all miraculously
die; I say those that would haue burnt the same, the which
was seene of many other, who haue giuen sufficient testimony
thereof. And within fewe dayes after, all the whole
linage of those dead persons did follow the same way, and
not one escaped. This miracle being spread throughout all
the kingdome, the naturals thereof did set vp many crosses
in all parts.</p>

<p>This they say was the principall motion that God put into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_307" id="Page_ii_307">[307]</a></span>
their hearts for to moue them to demande for such as shoulde
baptise them, and preach the holy gospell. Likewise, a
great helpe vnto the same was the declaration of the painted
cloth, which the aforesaid religious man did send to the king.
Since that time, there hath gone vnto the cittie of Machao
certaine naturals of that kingdome, who, being affectioned
vnto our faith, were baptised there: with the which, and
with the hope aforesaid, they are all sustained, till such time
as it is the pleasure of God to send them the remedie for
their soules, the which hee hath caused them to desire, which
cannot be long, according vnto that which hath beene seene,
and the miracles that God doth worke, the more for to kindle
their desire, as the myracle of the crosse before spoken off,
and others the which certaine Cochinchinos did declare in
the cittie of Machao, in anno 1583, and happened the same
yeare, and was very fresh in the memorie of all those of the
saide kingdome. The one of them was, that one of the
<span class="sidenote">Another myracle.</span>
Christians aforesaid went to visite a principall man that had
the palsie, and kept his bed many yeares before: and conferring
with his long sicknesse, he told of certaine myracles,
such as he had vnderstanding that was done by Christ our
Redeemer, when that he was man amongst men whome hee
redeemed: but in particular those which he did in the healing
of the like infirmities, such as he lay sicke of: alonely
with his deuine vertue, in touching of them with any part of
his garments or shadow. The iudge hearing this, hee had a
particular faith and devotion to him that had doone these
myracles that the Christian had told him, and asked what his
name was, and what signes and tokens he had: he told him
that his name was Jesus of Nazareth, Redeemer of the worlde,
the Sauiour and glorifier of men. And the better to declare
vnto him his signes, he shewed to him an image or picture
that he had of his, the which was giuen him such time as he
was baptised, printed in paper: and of Iesu Christ when he
ascended vp into heauen, the which, for lacke of churches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_308" id="Page_ii_308">[308]</a></span>
and other of greater volume, hee should haue continually
with him, and make his praiers thereunto. This sicke man
tooke it, and fixed his eies thereon with so great deuotion
and faith, in requesting him to giue him his health, and that
he would presently beleeue in him and bee baptised. At
the same instant, in the sight of them all, he felt himselfe
whole of the infirmitie that he had suffered so many yeares
before, and neuer could find any humaine remedy for the
same, although he had prooued an infinite number. He
straightwayes willed the Christian to baptise him, vnto whome
hee gaue a great summe of monie, the which hee receiued
against his will, and spent it in workes of mercie; and with
part thereof he bought a bigge barke, in the which at this
day he dooth passe people thorough a riuer, whereas they
were wont to passe great perill and danger, and hee doth it
for Gods sake, and receiueth nothing for the same.</p>

<p>A fewe dayes after, in another part of this kingdome,
there happened another myracle of no lesser substance
then the first, that is, there was a Cochinchina in the said
citie of Machao, who did aske to bee baptised of a barefoote
frier, which after that hee had catechised sufficiently, hee
gaue it vnto him: and after a great time that hee had beene
in his company, and had experience of his Christianitie and
deuotion, he gaue him licence for to returne vnto his country,
with a good token, that at his comming thither he would
procure to augment the desire of Christianitie, the which
God had begunne to kindle in their brest. This good neu
Christian did procure the same with so great care, that he
did profite very much (being holpen with the fauor of God,
who made him his instrument), hee healed certaine infirmities,
in shewing vnto the patients an image of our ladie, the
which he had continually about his necke, and had therunto
great deuotion, and woulde declare to them with great zeale
the Lords Prayer or Pater Noster. His fame was so much
spread abrode in all parts of this prouince, wherein he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_309" id="Page_ii_309">[309]</a></span>
dwelled, that it came vnto the ears of a mandarin, or principall
iudge of the same, who was many dayes in his bedde
a leaper, both of handes and feete, and neuer coulde finde
any phisition nor medecine that could giue him his health,
nor any other humaine remedie: who being verie desirous
to bee healed, hee sent for the saide Christian, and asked if
hee would take vppon him to heale him of that infirmitie, as
it was affirmed that hee had done by others of greater importance.
The Christian saide hee would; then the iudge
did promise vnto him for the same great giftes and rewardes,
but hee made no account thereof, but onelie requested of
him for reward, that after hee should bee hole, that he would
be baptised and become a Christian: the which he did accept,
and principally he shewed vnto him the image that hee
had of our lady, saying: If thou wilt beleeue in this lady,
that is heere ingraued, and in her most holy sonne Iesus
Christ, the Redeemer of the whole world, thou shalt presently
be made hole. This mandarin or iudge did beholde
the same with great attention, and thought on the words
which he had heard spoken, and in determining with himselfe
to beleeue the same, at the very point that he did put
it in execution, he was healed of al his infirmitie, a thing
which caused great admiration in all that prouince.</p>

<p>These myracles and that of the crosse, in a short time
being knowne abrode, haue caused such a desire vnto the
inhabitants of that kingdome to become Christians, that by
all manner of meanes possible they do procure the same: the
which is not followed for lacke of ministers, as aforesaid, and
is no smal griefe vnto them that Christianly doo put themselues
to consider how the diuel our aduersary doth carry
vnto his infernal mansion those soules which seeme to bee
well disposed for to enioy the benefite of God, and his eternal
goodnesse: all the which is for lacke of ministers, and
not for any other default. God remedie the same for his
mercies sake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_310" id="Page_ii_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>The said father Ignacio (whom, as I haue said, I do follow
in many things of this itinerario) did tell me, that as he
passed by this kingdome for to go vnto Spaine, he saw the
deuotion of the people thereof, and the great desire they
had to bee Christians, and how that the people were ready
and bent for to receiue the holy gospell, very humble and of
good vnderstanding. Hee would haue tarried for to baptise
them, and would haue done it onely for charity and compassion,
seeing with what deuotion they did demand the
same, and the great number of soules that were condemned;
but hee was constrained by force to go vnto Malaca, and
againe it seemed vnto him, that amongst so many people his
smal force might do little good: and that it were better for
him to go vnto Spaine, and to procure more companions to
helpe him, as he did, and returned with him, and with many
other rewards, of Pope Gregory the thirteenth receiued:
and he also receiued great fauours of the king of Spaine,
and with great hope, that his maiestie will giue his particular
aide, for to go thorow with this enterprise, which will not
be of small effect. I do beleeue of a truth, that in small
time all that kingdome shall be subiect vnto the Catholike
faith of Rome, and to be the gate whereby to enter the lawe
of the gospell into the mightie kingdome of China, for that
this of Cochinchina is vpon the same firme land, and their
language and customes are almost in one manner.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Their womenn are honest and shamefast.</span>
They are verie white people of this kingdome, and are
apparelled like vnto those of China: their women are verie
honest and shamefast, and their apparell is very curious and
gallant. The men weare their haire dispersed, and doo
combe and trim it with too much care. In all the countrie
almost, all of them are apparelled in silke, for that they haue
there verie much, and excellent good: the countrie is verie
holesome, and full of old folkes and children, which is a sufficient
proofe for the goodnesse thereof.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">They neuer had plague, pestilence, nor hunger.</span>
They say that they neuer had amongst them neither pestilence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_311" id="Page_ii_311">[311]</a></span>
nor hunger, which is the like as we haue said of the
kingdome of China.</p>

<p>Let him that can, do it in such sort that so great and infinite
number of soules that at this day are vnder the tyranny
of the diuell, may see them in the Christian libertie, and in
the other life inioy their creator.</p>

<span class="sidenote">The kingdome of Champa rich of drugs.</span>
called Champa, that although it be poore of gold and siluer,
yet is it verie rich of drugges and gallant wood, and great
stoare of prouision. This kingdome is very great and full of
people, and they some what whiter than those of Cochinchina;
they are as nigh and as willing to become Christians
as their neighbors, but for the performance thereof they doo
lacke that which the other doo. They haue the same lawes
and ceremonies as well the one as the other, and are all
idolaters, and doo worship the second causes, in the same
order as the Chinos do, vnto whome likewise they do make
one manner of acknowledging.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The kingdome of Camboia.</span>
From this iland you may go with ease vnto Malaca, leauing
on the right hand a kingdome which is called Camboia,
the which is great and very full of people, and all of them
affectioned to go to sea, and nauigation, by reason whereof
they haue an infinite number of vessels. It is a very fertill
country, with great stoare of prouision: there are elephants
in great number and abadas,<a name="FNanchor_1_92" id="FNanchor_1_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> which is a kind of beast so big
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_312" id="Page_ii_312">[312]</a></span>
as two great buls, and hath vppon his snowt a little horne.
At this day there is one of them at Madrid, the which was
brought out of the Indians to his maiesty, and many do go
to see it for a strange thing, and neuer the like seene in
Europe, whose skinne is so hard (according vnto the report)
that no man, although he be of great force and strength, can
passe it with a thrust. Some haue saide that it is an unicorne,
but I take it for the contrarie, and they are of my opinion
almost all those that haue beene in those partes, and haue
seene the true unicorne.</p>

<p>In this kingdome there is a religious man of the order of
S. Dominicke, called frier Siluester, whome God did carrie
into those parts for to remedy the soules that are therein:
hee dooth imploy himselfe to learne their natural language,
and to preach the holy gospell in the same tongue, and hath
them likewise prepared, that if he had any companions for
to help hym, they should obtayne much fruite for the
heauens: he hath sent and requested for some vnto the
India of Portingall, but they would neuer send him anie,
peraduenture by some sinister information, by men which
the diuell doth marke as instruments, for to stay and let the
saluation of those soules for euer to remayne in his tyrannicall
power. This fryer did write a letter vnto Malaca vnto
fryer Martin Ignacio, and vnto other religious men, intirely
requesting them for the loue of God to giue such order that
hee might be holpen with some religious men, of what order
soeuer, with certification that therein they shall doe great
seruice vnto God, and put remedie in those soules whome
he dare not baptise, for feare that after lacking the euangelical
refreshing, to water and cherish them, they returne
to bring forth that euill fruit of idolatrie. This petition did
not take effect according to his desire, for that there was not
to serue his turne, nor any that was vnoccupied. They
vnderstood of him that brought this letter, that the king
of that kingdome had in great veneration the sayd father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_313" id="Page_ii_313">[313]</a></span>
Siluestro, in so ample manner, as was the patriarck Ioseph
in Egypt: hee had in all that kingdome the seconde place,
and euery time that the king would speak with him, he gaue
him a chaire: and gaue him great priuiledges, and licence
for to preach the holy gospell throughout all the kingdome
without any contradiction, and for to edifie the churches and
all other thinges whatsoeuer he thought necessarie: this
king himselfe helping thereunto, by giuing of great gifts
and charitie: he said also that in al the kingdome there were
erected many crosses, and were had in great reuerence. And
for the confirmation of the truth hereof, the aforesaid frier
Ignacio did see in Malaca a present that the king of this
kingdome of Camboia did send vnto another friend of his:
and amongst many things contained therin of great riches
and curiositie, there were two crosses very great and wel
made, of a gallant wood and very sweete, and all garnished
very richly with siluer and gold, with their titles enamiled.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The kingdome of Sian.</span>
Nigh vnto this kingdome is that of Sian, in the hight of
fourteene degrees from the pole artike, and three hundred
leagues from Machao, wheras the Portugals do go to trade:
<span class="sidenote">The mother of idolatrie.</span>
it is the mother of all idolatrie, and the place from whence
hath proceeded many sectes, vnto Iapon, China, and Pegu.
It is a flourishing countrie, and well replenished of all such
things as be requisite for to merite the name to be good.
There be in it manie elephants and abadas, and other beasts
that are nourished in that countrie: besides this, it is very
<span class="sidenote">Faint hearted people.</span>
rich of mettals, and gallant sweete woode. The people of
this kingdome for the most part are faint-hearted or cowards,
for which occasion, although they are infinite in number, yet
are they subiect vnto the king of Pegu, who ouercame them
long time since, in a battell (as afterwards shall be declared):
and they doo pay him ordinarily great and heauy tributes. They
would be conuerted very easily unto the faith of Iesu Christ,
and would leaue their idols, if they had any to preach vnto
them: yea and would subiect themselues vnto any king or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_314" id="Page_ii_314">[314]</a></span>
lord that woulde fauour them, and not vnto this whom now
they do obey, for that hee dooth intreate them tyrannously.
They haue amongst them many religious men after their
fashion, who doo liue in common, and leade an asper and
sharp life: for the which they are had of al the rest in great
veneration. The penance which they do is wonderfull and
strange, as you may iudge by some things that I will declare
here: amongst a great number that be tolde of them, there
are none of them that can marrie, neither speake to any
woman, and if by chance he do, they are without remission
punished by death. They go alwayes barefoote, and very
poorely apparelled, and do eate nothing but rice and greene
herbes, and this they do aske for charitie euery day, going
from doore to doore with their wallet at their backes, alwayes
with their eyes looking on the ground, with such modesty
and honesty, that it is to be wondred at: they doo not craue
their charity, neither take it with their hands, nor do any
other thing but cal or knocke, and stand still, till such time
as they giue them their answer, or put something into their
wallets. It is told of them for a truth, that many times for
penance they do put themselues starke naked in the heate of
the sunne, which is there very great, for that the country
is in twenty sixe degrees of the equinoctiall, whereas they
are much troubled there with gnats, whereof there is an
infinite number, and is a thing that if they did passe it for
Gods sake, it is a kinde of martyrdome of great desert. God
for his mercy lighten them with his grace, that this which
they do smally vnto the profite of their soules, may bee the
occasion that after they are baptised, they may deserue for
the same many degrees of glory.</p>

<p>Likewise in secrete they doo great penance, and doo rise
vp at midnight to praie vnto their idols, and they do it in
quiers, as is vsed amongst vs Christians. It is not permitted
them any rentes, nor any other kinde of contractation: and
if they bee seene to deale in any, they are detested and
hated, as an heretike is amongst vs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_315" id="Page_ii_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>For this kind of asper liuing, the which they do, according
vnto the report, for the loue of heauen, and that with
great zeale, they are respected of the common people for
saints, and for such they do reuerence them, and do commit
them vnto their praiers, when they are in any trouble or
infirmity. These and many other things more be declared
of them in like order, which may serue for to confound vs,
that confessing we do not obserue and keepe, hauing for the
same our sure reward, not of humain interest, but that which
God hath prepared for the good in heauen.</p>

<p>The law of the gospell in this kingdome would bring
foorth much fruite, for that the people are charitable, and
louers of vertue, and of them that haue it. This experience
had the father Ignacio and his companions in China, at such
time as they were prisoners, where there were in a city certain
ambassadors from the king of Syan, who were bound to
the court, and there they vnderstood that the Spaniards were
sentenced to death for entring into that country without
licence: they went to visite them, and when they saw them
with their asper habites and very poore, and did resemble
very much the habit of their religious men, they had so great
affection vnto them, that ouer and aboue they sent them good
charity, the which was two bags of rice, much fish and fruits:
they did offer to them al the money they would desire, and
to ransome them in al that the judges would demand for
them: in recompence of this good wil they shewed vnto the
Spaniards, they did verifie that aforesaide, that they are great
louers of vertue.</p>

Nigh vnto this kingdome of Syan there are two kingdomes

Patane; they belong both vnto one king, who is a Moore
and of the linage Malaya, yet notwithstanding the people of

<p><span class="sidenote">The Straight of Malaca is vnder the line.</span>
This straight of Malaca is vnder the equinoctiall line, and
is accounted from the kingdome of Cochinchina vnto it three
hundred and seuenty-six leagues: this is an euill straight
and very dangerous for ships that passe thorough it, for very
few times it is without stormes or some other greater danger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_317" id="Page_ii_317">[317]</a></span>
as it happened vnto a verie great shippe in the mouth of the
straight, in the presence of frier Martin Ignacio, the which
in verie little space was swallowed vp with the sea, and in it
more then three hundred thousand ducats in merchandice
that was within her, although the successe thereof our people
did attribute it more vnto the iust iudgement of God than
vnto the storme, for that according as they were informed,
they had committed grieuous offences, at the time when she
sanke: for being very nigh with his shippe in the which he
went, and many other more, they felt not, neither had any
suspition of any danger. From this straight to go vnto
Malaca, you coast alongest the sea, fiue and twentie leagues:
all which coast is full of great, mightie, and thicke woods,
by reason whereof, as also for that it is not inhabited, there
are many tygers, elephants, and mightie great lysards, and
other furious beastes.</p>

<p>The citie of Malaca, in our pole articke, is eleuated from
the equinoctiall onely one degree: of ancient time it was the
most principallest citie of all these kingdomes, and resident
therein a mightie king, a Moore, but after it was conquered
by the Portugals, who in these wars did wonderfull things
of great force and courage: they did driue foorth all the
Moores out of the same, and out of all the borders, and
made of their Mezquita or temple (which was a singular
peece of worke) a high church, as it doth remaine vnto this
day: there are also three monasteries of religious men, one
of S. Dominicke, an other of S. Francis, and the third of
the companie of Iesus, or Iesuites. It is a verie temperate
countrie, being so nigh the equinoctiall line: the reason is,
for that euery weeke ordinarily it rayneth three or foure
times (which is the greatest cause of health in all that countrie),
and thereby is made woonderfull fruitfull, and with
great abundance of prouision; but particularly of fruites,
for there is great store, and some sortes neuer seene in Europe,
amongst the which there is one that is called in the

affirmed by manie that haue gone about the worlde, that it
doth exceede in sauour all others that euer they had seene or
tasted: it is in forme like vnto a mellon, whose ryne is somewhat
harde, and hath vpon it little white prickes which
seemeth like haire, and within the fruite be partitions, which
be of the colour like vnto <i>maniar blanco</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_96" id="FNanchor_2_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and of so good
<span class="sidenote">A daintie kind of meat.</span>
sauour and tast is it. Some do say that haue seene it, that it
seemeth to be that wherewith Adam did transgresse, being
carried away by the singular sauour. The leaues which this

cap. 9 and 10, and in the <i>Paralipomenon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_99" id="FNanchor_2_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> cap. 9, that went
and returned again laden with gold and rich tymber for to
adorne the temple of Ierusalem, and of many other curious
things, whose memorie doth remaine vnto this day amongst
the naturall people, although diffusedly, but not so much
as those that haue it out of the Holy Scripture, neither so
true. This iland is vnder the equinoctial line, so that the
one halfe doth extend vnto the pole artick, and the other
halfe vnto the poole antarticke. It hath in longitude 230
leagues, and in latitude three score and seuen leagues: and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_320" id="Page_ii_320">[320]</a></span>
is so nigh vnto Malaca, that in some parts it is less than ten
leagues. In this kingdom there are many lords and rulers,
yet he that hath the greatest part thereof is a Moore, and is
<span class="sidenote">The richest iland in the world.</span>
called Achan; it is one of the richest ilands in al the world,
for that it hath many mynes of fine golde, of the which
(although there is a law that they cannot take out of them
more than is necessarie) yet there is great abundance carried
from thence to Malaca, Turkie, and many other places.
There is gathered vpon this iland great abundance of pepper
and beniewyn<a name="FNanchor_3_100" id="FNanchor_3_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> of Boninas, in great quantity, out of whose
trees (whereof there is great woods) there come foorth so
sweet a smel that it seemeth an earthly paradice, and was
wont to be smelled twenty leagues at sea, for which respect
the ships that saile that way do come so nigh the lande as
they may to haue the comfort of that smell. There is also
much camphora, and all kinde of spices; by reason wherof
there commeth vnto this kingdome to traficke, many Turkes
that come in ships and foystes<a name="FNanchor_4_101" id="FNanchor_4_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> out of the Red Sea. Also
there doth traficke thether those of the kingdom of Sunda,
Iaua the great, and Ambayno, and others that are there nigh
vnto them. Vnto this iland came certaine Portingals to
buy and sell, whereas they were all slaine, and some for the
profession of the faith; for the which they are holden for
martyrs of Iesu Christ, by the opinion of Christians that doo
dwell nigh, when they vnderstood the cause. The most part
of this kingdome are Moores; and therefore they do abhor
the Christians, and do make with them all the warre they
can, but in especiall with them that dwell in Malaca, whom
many times they haue put in great danger of their liues, and
losse of their goods.</p>

<p>Running from this kingdome of Malaca by the north and
northwest cost is the mightie kingdome of Pegu, the which
is in bignes greater then Samatra, and equall in riches, especially
of pearls and al sorts of stones, and very fine christall:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_321" id="Page_ii_321">[321]</a></span>
there is great store of prouision, and an infinite number of
people, and the king thereof is mightie: to whom (as we
haue said) the king of Cyan doth pay tribute, because he
ouercame him in a battaile which he had with him in the
yeare 1568, according vnto the common opinion: the occasion
was, that, vnderstanding how that the saide king of Syan
had in his power a white elephant (whome those of the kingdome
of Pegu do worship for god), the king sent to buy the
same, and to giue for it so much as he would esteeme or
value it: but he utterly denied the same, and saide that he
would not let him haue it for all that he had in his kingdom:
the which caused so great anger vnto the king, that hee
called together all the souldiers that he could make, with
determination to get by force of armes that which he could
not by faire meanes and great ritches: in the which he did
so great diligence, that in a fewe dayes hee had ioyned together
<span class="sidenote">An armie of a million and sixe hundred thousand men.</span>
an armie of a million and sixe hundreth thousande of
men of warre, with whome hee departed vnto the saide
kingdome of Syan, which was from his kingdome two
hundreth leagues, and did not onely performe his pretence
in bringing away the white elephant, but did also make the
king tributarie, as he is vnto this day, as hath bin declared
vnto you.</p>

<p>The rites of the people and priestes of this countrie, doo
resemble much those of the kingdome of Syan: they haue
amongst them many monasteries of men that liue honestly,
solitarie, and with great penance, and people verie apt to
receiue the holy gospell. For ouer and aboue that they are
docible and of a good vnderstanding, they are men which
do studie philosophie, and are well inclyned and charitable,
and haue a particular affection vnto vertue, and vnto such as
they do knowe that haue vertue, and very friendly to remedie
the necessitie of their poore neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The kingdome of Arracon.</span>
Going from this kingdome towardes the north is the kingdome
of Arracon, verie plentifull of prouision, but few things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_322" id="Page_ii_322">[322]</a></span>
of contractation or marchandice, which is the occasion that it
is not well knowen to the Spaniardes, for that they haue not
gone thether. They doo vnderstand of the naturall people
and of their customes, that they are very apt to receiue the
holie gospell.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The kingdome of Vangala.</span>
From this kingdome alongst the same coast, you came
vnto the kingdome of Vangala,<a name="FNanchor_1_102" id="FNanchor_1_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> through the which doth passe
the riuer Ganges, one of the foure that comme foorth of
paradice terrenall, the which being vnderstood by a certaine
king of this kingdome, he determined to cause some to ascend
vp that riuer till such time as he had found the head spring
or head thereof, and therewith paradice: for the which effect
he commanded to be made diuers sortes of barkes, both small
and great, and sent in them vp the riuer certaine men (of
whose diligence hee had long experience), and were prouided
with victuals for many daies, and gaue commandement that
presently after that they had discouered that which hee desired,
that they should return with great speede, for to giue
him particular and true relation, with pretence foorthwith to
go himselfe to inioy the things which he thought necessarie
to be seene, and woorthie to be desired, of his trauaile, and
in a place so delightfull.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_102" id="Footnote_1_102"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_102"><span class="label">[102]</span></a> Bengal.</p></div>

<p>These men did nauigate vp the riuer many monethes, and
came vnto a place whereas the water came foorth so softly
and with so small noyse, which gaue them to vnderstande
that they were not farre from the first head thereof, which
should be paradice, that which they went to seeke. They
gaue to vnderstand that in this place, after they had seene so
many tokens, and comforted themselues with maruellous
sweete smels, and aires of great delight, they thought verily
that they had bin in the paradice terrenall. And more, when
as they came vnto that place, where as the riuer did runne
so peaceable, and the ayre so delicate and sweet, there entred
into the hearts of them all, so great and extraordinarie ioy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_323" id="Page_ii_323">[323]</a></span>
that they seemed to be in the true paradice, and forgot all
the trauaile that they had passed for to come thether, and of
any other thing that did signifie paine or griefe. But when
they did intend to go forwardes with this their pretence and
intent, and thereunto did put all diligence possible, they
found by experience that all their trauaile was in vaine, and
howe that they remained alwaies in one place: and coulde
not vnderstande from whence did come or proceede that contradiction,
they could not find in the waters by reason of the
peaceablenesse thereof.</p>

<p>This experience being done, attributing it vnto a miserie
because they could not get a shore, they returned backe
againe by the same riuer, till they came to their owne kingdome,
whereas they arriued in a very short time, and gaue
their king to vnderstand (who sent them) all as aforesaide,
and many other thinges more, the which I do leaue out for
that I do take it <i>apocripha</i>. They hold it for a certaintie
that the riuers Eufrates and Tygris are not far from this
riuer Ganges; and it seemeth to be true, for both of them
doo discharge their currents, or water, into the Persian sea,
the which is not farre distant from this kingdome.</p>

<p>The people of this kingdome haue this riuer in great reuerence,
which is the occasion that they neuer enter into the same
but with great respect and feare. And when they doo washe
or bath themselues in it, they haue it for a certaintie that
they remaine cleare from all their sinnes. Likewise this
kingdome, with great ease, might be conuerted vnto the
Catholike faith as it seemeth, for that they haue amongst
them many morall rites, ceremonies, and vertues.</p>

<p>Running alongest the coast from Vengala, is the kingdome
of Masulapatar, and certaine other kingdomes nigh vnto the
same: they be all gentiles, as the rest of their borderers, yet
it is vnderstood, with great facilitie they would leaue their
opinions. It is a kingdome that hath great abundance of
prouision, and lacke of things of contractation or marchandice,
which is the occasion that they are little knowen.</p>

<p>Trauailing a little forwardes, is the kingdome of Coromandel,
whose chiefe citie is called Calamina, and nowe
vulgarly Malipur,<a name="FNanchor_1_103" id="FNanchor_1_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and is there whereas was martyred the
happie apostle S. Thomas. And they say that at this day
there remaineth some of his relickes, by whom God did many
myracles. The naturall people therefore haue a particular
memory vntill this day of that saint.</p>

<p>This citie at this day is populared with Portingals and
with the naturall people: there is in it a church, wherein
is comprehended the house whereas was, and died, the holy
apostle: this countrie belongeth vnto the king of Visnaga,
who although he be a gentile, he hath great reuerence and
respect vnto the house of the holy apostle, and for particular
deuotion he doth giue euerie yeare a certaine charitie.
There is in this citie two couentes of religious men, the one
of the companie of Iesus, and the other of the order of
S. Francis.</p>

<p>From this citie of Calamina to that of Visnaga there
wheras the king is, it is fiue and thirtie leagues by land.
This king is mightie, and his kingdome very great and full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_325" id="Page_ii_325">[325]</a></span>
of people, and hath great rentes. They say that onely the
rent he hath of fine gold, is worth vnto him three millions,
of the which he spendeth but one onely, and doth keepe
euerie yeare two millions in his treasorie, the which according
vnto the report and fame, is at this day with many millions.
He hath twelue principall or chiefe captaines, and
euerie one of them hath the gouernement of an infinite number
of people and hath great rent for the same, for he that
hath least rent hath sixe hundred thousand ducats yearely.
Euerie one of them are bound to giue the king to eate, and
all the people of his house, one month in the yeare; so that
by this account the twelue captaines which are the lordes of
the kingdome (and as wee might say) dukes, doo beare his
cost all the whole yeare. The million the which he doth
spend, is in giftes and in extraordinarie thinges. The king
hath in his house, what with wiues, seruants, and slaues,
nigh about fourteene thousand persons, and in his stable
ordinarily a thousand horse, and for his seruice and garde
eight hundreth elephants, of whom he doth spend euerie
day eight hundreth ducats. The garde of his person is foure
thousand horsemen, to whom he giueth great wages. He
hath also in his house three hundreth wiues, besides a great
number of concubines: they goe all gallantly apparelled, and
with rich iewels, of the which there are of great estimation
in that kingdome, they do almost euerie three daies change
newe colors of apparell. They do ordinarily vse colors of
precious stones, such as are called in Spaine <i>ojo de gato</i>, cats
eies. They haue great store of saphires, pearles, diamonds,
rubies, and many other stones, that are in that kingdome in
great abundance.</p>

<p>Amongest all these wiues there is one that is as legitimate,
whose children doo inherite: and if it so fall out that she is
barren, the first that is borne of any of the other doth inherite:
which is the occasion that they neuer lacke a successor in
that kingdome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_326" id="Page_ii_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>When the king of this kingdome doth die, they do carrie
him foorth into a mightie fielde, with great sadnesse and
mourning apparell, and there in the presence of those twelue
peeres afore saide, they do burne his bodie with wood of
sandalo, which is of a great smell, with the which they do
make a great fire.</p>

<p>After that the bodie of the king is burned and consumed,
they throwe into the same the wiues that hee best loued,
with seruants and slaues, those that he most esteemed in his
lifetime: the which they do with so great content, that euery
one dooth procure to be the first for to enter into the fire,
and they that are last do thinke themselues vnhappie. All
these do say that they go to serue the king in the other life,
whereas they shalbe with great ioy. This is the occasion
that they goe with so good a will to die, and carrie with
them the most richest and festiuall apparell they haue. Of
this is gathered that they do beleeue the immortalitie of the
soule, for that they doo confesse there is another life, and
that thither they do returne and liue for euer without ende.
They are people that would be conuerted with the like facilitie
vnto the holy gospell as their neighbours, if there went
any thether to preach.</p>

<p>Three score and tenne leagues from this citie, there is a
pagode or temple of idols, whereas is a rich faire euery yeare:
it is a very sumptuous building, and edified in a place so
high, that it may be seene many leagues before you come
vnto it.</p>

<p>It hath ordinarily foure thousande men of garde, who are
paid with the rent of the temple, the which is rich and verye
good. There is nigh vnto the same many mynes of golde
and precious stones, and that is taken out of them is rent
vnto the temple. There is in it a priest of the idolles, whom
they call in their language Brama, and is as the high priest
in that countrie. All the people of the land do come vnto
him, to vnderstand the doubtes of their manner of liuing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_327" id="Page_ii_327">[327]</a></span>
and he doth dispence with them in many things that be prohibited
by their lawes, the which he may do according vnto
the sayd lawes, and manie times he doth dispence certaine
of them. But here one to be laughed at, which is, that when
a woman cannot suffer the condition of her husbande, or is
wearie of him for other occasions, she goeth vnto this Brama,
and giuing vnto him a peece of golde, which may be to the
<span class="sidenote">A strange custome.</span>
value of a ducat in Spaine, he doth vnmarry them, and
setteth her at libertie that she may marry with an other, or
with many if she please: and in token of this she is giuen a
marke with an yron vpon her right shoulder, so that with
that alone she remaineth at libertie, and her husband cannot
do vnto her any harme for the same, neither compell her to
returne againe to his company.</p>

<p>There are in this kingdome many mynes of verie fine
diamonds, and are had in great estimation, and very well
knowen in Europe. There hath beene found in them a stone
of so fine and of so great value, that but few yeares past, the
king did sell the same vnto an other mightie king his borderer,
<span class="sidenote">A diamond sold for a million of gold.</span>
called Odialcan, for a million of golde, besides other
thinges of value that hee gaue him ouer and aboue.<a name="FNanchor_1_104" id="FNanchor_1_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> It is
a healthfull countrie, with very good and fresh ayres, rich of
prouisions, and of all other necessaries, not only for the
humane life, but also for curiositie and delightes that be
therein. It is in fourteene degrees towardes the pole artico.
All the people therein are faint-hearted and cowards, and
for little trauaile, which is the occasion that they are nothing
affectionate vnto warres, and is vnderstoode with great facilitie
they would receiue the gospell.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_104" id="Footnote_1_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> This is in all probability the great diamond mentioned by Tavernier,
vol. ii, p. 249, as being in the possession of the Great Mogul. It was
found in the washings near Caldore, to the east of Golconda, about the
year 1550. Professor Tennant, in his lecture on "Gems" before the
Society of Arts, expresses his opinion that the Koh-i-noor formed a portion
of this large diamond.</p></div>

<p>Nigh vnto the same there is an other little kingdome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_328" id="Page_ii_328">[328]</a></span>
called Mana, in the which there is a towne with Portingals,
the which is called in their language Negapatan; there is in
the same a conuent of the order of S. Francis, whose religious
friers, although they are but few, do occupie themselues
in the converting of the naturall people thereof, and
it is to be beleeued that they shall reape much fruite and
doo good, for they haue giuen showes of the same: for that
about three yeares past the prince of that countrie was conuerted
by the preaching of the same fryers, who went now
to receiue the holy baptisme with great and incredible ioy
vnto the Christians. All the rest of the kingdoms (as it is
beleeued) will shortly imitate him. In this iland there are
many pearls and aliofar, al very good, round, and fine.</p>

<p>The afore saide father Martin Ignacio, departed with his
<span class="sidenote">Ilandes of Nicobar.</span>
companions from this cost, and went towards the Ilands of
Nicobar, whereas are many Moores and gentiles, al mingled
the one with the other. They did not stay there, but presently
passed to the town of Cuylan, which is inhabited with
Portingals, and from Malaca foure hundred and sixteene
leagues. This iland is situated from sixe vnto ten degrees
vnder our pole, and hath in longitude three score and sixe
leagues, and nine and thirtie of latitude. Of old time it was
an iland much celebrated, and in those partes had in great
reuerence, for that it is saide that there dwelt and died there
in times past, men, whose soules are in heauen, and are
celebrated and honoured by them of the countrie as though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_329" id="Page_ii_329">[329]</a></span>
they were gods, with many sacrifices and orations, the which
they do ordinarily. There come from other kingdomes bordering
thereupon, vnto this ilande, many pilgrimes; but
our people could neuer vnderstand the ground and occasion
thereof, neither how they liued, whom they doo hold for
saints. There is vpon the same iland a very high mountaine,
which is called Pico de Adan, which father Martin did see,
and did heare the naturall people thereof say, that it had that
name, for that by the same Adam went vp into heauen;
but what Adam it was they could not declare.</p>

<p>There is on this Pico like a monasterie, the which the
naturall people doo call pagode: at one time they had therein
<span class="sidenote">An apes tooth for a god.</span>
an apes tooth, the which they did worship for their God:
and there came thither vnto that effect some two hundred
and three hundred leagues. [It so happened, in the yeare 1554,
the vizroy of India, called Don Pedro Mascarenas, sent an army
vnto this kingdome, with many Portugals, with intent to reduce
them vnto the obedience of the king of Portugall, all of that
country, as they were before, who few yeares past did rise
against them, and tooke away and denied their fewter.<a name="FNanchor_1_105" id="FNanchor_1_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The
souldiers did sack that pagoda or monastery, and thinking
to finde some treasure therein, they broke it, and beat it
downe vnto the foundation: and there they found the aforesaid
apes tooth, the which they did worship, put in a chest
of golde and stones, and carried it vnto Goa, vnto the said
vizroy. When that this was vnderstood and knowne to
other kings their borderers, and vnto him of Pegu, of this
losse (the which of them was iudged to bee great) they sent
their ambassadors to the said vizroy, that they might in the
name of them all, demaunde the saide tooth, the which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_330" id="Page_ii_330">[330]</a></span>
did worship, and to offer for the ransome thereof seuen hundred
thousand ducats of gold. The viceroy would haue
giuen it them for that quantitie of gold which they did offer,
and would haue done it in effect, if it had not bin for the
archbishop of Goa, who was called Don Gaspar, and other
religious men, who did disturbe him, putting great scrupulositie,
and laide vnto his charge the hurt that come by their
idolatrie, in giuing them the same, of the which he should
giue a straight account vnto God. The which did so much
in him, that he dispatched away the ambassador, without
any regard of the gold that they would haue giuen him in
their presence: he did deliuer the same vnto the said archbishop
and religious men, and they before their eies did
break it, and burnt it, and threw the dust thereof into the
sea, which was not a little woonder vnto the said embassadors,
to see how little they did esteeme so great a quantitie
of golde, and for a thing which they esteemed not, but threw
it into the sea with so great liberalitie.]</p>

<p>This ilande is fertile, peaceable, and healthfull, and all
full of woods, and there are mountaines very thicke of orange
trees, siders, limas, plantanos, and palmas, and many synamon
trees, which be the best in all the world, and of most
strength and effect, for the which they go to buy, for to
bring it vnto Europe, and they giue it for a small price.
Likewise there is pepper, but the naturall people did pull
vp certaine hils that were ful of it, and of synamon, because
they saw there came from farre to buy these two commodities,
and fearing that it would be an occasion that their country
would be taken from them. It is a countrie of great
prouision, and doth bring foorth mightie elephants, and they
say that there is many mynes of diamonds, rubies, and other
stones that are called girasolis. In no part of this Orientall
Indies, there was none of so good a beginning in the conuersion

good will they did receiue the law of the gospell, and had
edified many churches, and fourteene monasteries of the
same religion: but few yeares past, a king of that kingdome,
being weary of certaine things, which in all that Indians are
very publicke, he forsooke the religion and faith he had receiued,
and did raise and destroy many Portingals that were
there inhabited, thrusting forth all the religious men that did
baptise, and minister the sacraments. This euill king was
called Raxu. Many of them that were christened, and content
with the faith of Iesus Christ they had receiued, detesting
that which this tirannous king had done, they went and
dwelt in the company of the Portingals, and others did build
a town, the which is called in their language Columbo,
whereas is a great number of them: vnto this day do indure
throughout al that kingdom the crosses, in token of their
ancient Christianitie: alongst all the coast they doe vse
many galiotas or gallyes, and goe with them, robbing and
spoyling al thereaboutes. The naturall people doo say, that
with a good will they would againe returne and receiue the
law of the gospell, if they had it there preached. From this
iland, after they had passed a little gulfe, they came vpon
the coast of a kingdome called Tutucurin, and ran all alongest
the cost of the same, running from the cape of Comerin to
Cuylan. Here there is a pagode or temple of their gods
very great and rich, thether come all the gentiles of that
kingdom, at certain feasts in the year with great deuotion:
there is in it a triumphant chariot, so great that twentie horse
cannot mooue it, they bring it foorth in publike vpon their
festiual daies, and is carried by elephants, and by an infinite
number of men, who voluntarily do hale and pull at certaine
roapes that are made fast therunto. Upon the highest of
this chariot is made a tabernacle very richly adorned, and
within the same an idol, whom they do worship: then immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_332" id="Page_ii_332">[332]</a></span>
vnder the same are the kings wiues that go
singing. They doo bring it forth with much musicke and
reioysings, and do carry it a good way in procession, and
amongest many thinges of honor that they doo vnto it, they
<span class="sidenote">A brutish vse.</span>
do vse one so brute and beastly as the reader may well iudge
thereof, which is, that many of them doo cut peeces of their
owne fleshe and doo throwe it vnto the idoll, and the other,
not contented with this, doo throwe themselues on the
grounde that the chariot may passe ouer them, and there
they remaine all to peeces. Those that do die in this sort,
they account them for great saints, and are had in singular
veneration. Many other maners and fashions of idolatrie is
declared of this kingdome, and more beastly than this we
haue spoken of, the which I let passe because I would not
be tedious in this itinerario. All the people of this kingdom
be very bad and ill inclined, for which cause the fathers of
the company of Iesus, that are in certaine townes nigh vnto
the same, cannot as yet bring them out of their errors, although
they haue put therein great care and diligence.</p>

<p>Upon the same cost, and a little distant from this kingdom,
there is a towne of Portingals called Coulan, and
twentie-fiue leagues further a citie which is called Cochin,
in the which there are religious men of St. Francis, of S.
Dominicke, and of S. Austin, and of the companie of Iesus,
who haue there a very good studie or seminarie, whereas
they do bring foorth much fruite. Nigh vnto this citie is
Santo Tome, whereas are many baptised and good Christians,
very abstinent and chast, vnto whom the patriarkes of
Babylon doo prouide them of bishops: the authoritie where
with they do it is not knowen, nor whence they haue it, for
that as I do vnderstand, seat apostolicke did neuer giue
it them. About the same matter, at this present there is in
Rome a bishop of this kingdome, and one of the kingdome
of Pimienta, with whom I haue talked diuers times, and is
come thether to giue his obedience vnto the pope, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_333" id="Page_ii_333">[333]</a></span>
knowe of him the order that his pleasure is should be obserued,
in receiuing of those bishops which come thether by
the commandement of the patriarke. In this kingdome
there are many kings, but the principallest of them is he of
Cochin, and next vnto him, he of Coulan, and nigh vnto them
are many petie kings, as is hee of Mangate and Cranganor,
and are all gentils, although amongst them there are mixed
many Moores. There hath bin found in this kingdome certaine
Iewes, that haue gone from Palestina and those parts.
There is in this countrie vniuersally, a lawe verie strange
and little heard of, which is, that the sonnes doo not inherite
after their fathers, but his brothers sonne, and the reason
they giue for the same is, for that they haue no certaintie of
their children, for that they haue no wiues proper nor appointed
to themselues, I promise you it seemeth to me, their
reason to be as barbarous as their law, for that the like
inconuenience doth folow their brothers children. They
haue many rites and blindnes amongst them, but one aboue
all the rest, which is, that in certaine feastes amongst them,
they do vse bathes, and after that they are bathed, they say
that they remaine free and cleare from all their sinnes.
They haue many augorismes, of whom I will not intreat, for
that they are not worthy of memorie. In this country is
gathered most of the pepper that is brought into Europe, for
which cause this kingdome is called that of the Pimienta.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The chapter doth treate of many kingdomes of the Newe World, and of the
particular and curious things of them.</i></p></div>


<p>The aforesaid father went from Cochin to the kingdome of
<span class="sidenote">The kingdome of Cananor, Tanaor, and Calicart.</span>
Cananor, and passed by Tanaor and Calicut, which is called
of the naturall people Malabar, they are like kingdomes, but
in them much people. In that of Cananor, there are inhabited
many Portingals and religious men of the order of
S. Francis: it is a countrie in all things like vnto Cochin, for
which cause, and for that they obserue and keepe one maner
of customs and rites, I remit the touching of this kingdome
to the other aforesaide.</p>

<p>Then forwards on there are other two small kingdoms, the
one is called Barcelor, and the other, Mangalor; there be in
them some Christians: it is a good countrie and rich, and
hath it for certaine, that within a little time they will be all
baptised. From this kingdome they went vnto Goa, a principall
citie, and inhabited with Portingals, and is as the metropolitan
of all those kingdomes: it is in fifteen degrees of
height, and is set from Cochin vnto it a hundreth leagues,
this citie is situated in a little iland, compassed round about
with water, and in compasse but onely four leagues, and is
diuided from the firme land of Odialcan by a mightie riuer.
It is a good countrie and peaceable, and doth inioy a very
faire and pleasant riuer. In this citie ordinarily is resident
the viceroy of the India and the archbishoppe: there are
many churches and conuents; and besides the high church,
there are fourteene parish churches, besides fifteen hermitages
that are within and without the citie: there be four
conuents, all very sumptuous, of S. Dominicke, of S. Austin,
of S. Francis, and of the company of Iesus. And without
the cittie there is another of <i>Recoletos Franciscanos</i>, reformed
Francis friers.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Ilandes Salcete and Bardes.</span>
Nigh vnto this iland are those of Salcete and Bardes, there
whereas the religious men of S. Francis, and the companie
of Iesus haue certaine Christian townes. Few yeares past,
the Gentiles of Sancete<a name="FNanchor_1_106" id="FNanchor_1_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> did kill certaine fathers of the company
of Iesus, in abhorring the faith, who died with great
spirite and strength: so that I beleeue they went into ioy
with God.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_106" id="Footnote_1_106"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_106"><span class="label">[106]</span></a> Misspelt for Salcete&mdash;Salsette.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">The towne of Chaul, Basayn, Damaun, Cambaya.</span>
Beyond Goa, on the same coast towardes the north, is in
eighteene degrees and a halfe from the towne of Chaul, and
beyond that Basayn, and nigh thereunto Damaun; all these
three townes are inhabited with Portugals; and the farthest
is the prouince of Cambaya, subiect vnto the grand Tartar,
or Mogor, by an other name. Two and fortie leagues beyond
<span class="sidenote">The cittie of Diu.</span>
that is the cittie called Diu, whereas is a very faire and
good fortresse of Portugals, with a very great hauen and
sure, whose name doth extend throughout all Turkey.</p>

<p>Two hundred and seuentie leagues beyond that is the citie
<span class="sidenote">The cittie of Oromuz.</span>
of Oromuz, on the coast of Persia, and in the same hath the
saide Portugals an other fortresse, much better then that of
Diu, and more inexpugnable: it is the biggest in al the Indians,
but not of so great name as that of Diu. In this
cittie of Oromuz they gather nothing else but salt, and that in
great aboundance; yet, notwithstanding, it is replenished of
all that may be imagined, for that there is brought thither
from Persia and Arabia great prouision, and many other
curiosities. They say, that from this place they may easily
go to Venice, taking their way to Aleph, and to Tripoli in
Soria.</p>

<p>All this coast of the Indias vnto Persia is inhabited with
many and mightie kingdomes, in which there are an infinite
number of people: one of them is that of Odialon, the which
<span class="sidenote">Odialon.</span>
is very rich, and of much people, and all Moores. Nigh
vnto this is another called Disamaluco, harde by the kingdome
of the great Tartar, which, in their language, is called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_336" id="Page_ii_336">[336]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Mogor.</span>
Mogor, the which, next vnto that of China (I doo thinke),
is the greatest in all the world, as may be collected in that
which is declared of the mightinesse thereof, both in ancient
and latter histories. On the other side of Oromuz is
<span class="sidenote">Persia.</span>
the kingdome of Persia, whose king is Xactamas, or Ismael
Sophi, great Soldan of Egypt, descending by lyneall desent
from the Soldan, Campson Guario, whom Selim, emperor of
the Tartaros did ouercome in battell, nigh vnto Damasco, in
the yeare 1516.</p>

<p>All those of this kingdome are Moores, although they and
the Turkes are as the Christians and heretikes, for that the
Persians do follow the interpretation of the lawe of Mahomet
of certain alies, or doctors. And the Turkes go a different
way, and do follow others. This contractation and different
interpretation of the lawe, is the occasion that betwixt the
one and the other there is ordinarily cruell warres: and it
is the great mercy of God, for that the Turke may not haue
any space to come and do euil vnto his Christians; or if he
do come, he shall be ouertaken with the Persians, his enimy
the Sophi, and intrapped with all the euill that they can do
vnto him: who that although he be a Moore, and of the sect
of Mahomet, yet he is a friend vnto Christians.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arabia Felix.</span>
Neere unto the straite of Oromuz is Arabia Felix, where
as all the inhabitants are of the sect of Mahomet, and doo
follow the same interpretation that the Sophi doth. So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_337" id="Page_ii_337">[337]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">The Red Sea.</span>
running a long by Arabia, you come straight vnto the Red
Sea, or Arabico, the which hath foure hundred and fiftie
leagues of longitude, and in some partes it is of a mightie
depth: the water thereof seemeth to bee red, although taking
it out thereof it is white: the cause thereof is for that the
ground vnder the water is of the same colour. By reason
whereof, when as the sun doth shine thereon it seemeth red,
and thereby it hath got the name the which it hath vnto this
day. By this sea, and by that of Basora, the great Turk
doth carrie much spicerie, silkes, and cloth of golde, and all
riches out of the orientall Indias, the which may easily be
disturbed, but the way how is not for this place nor time.
On the other side is the land of Abexin, which is that of
<span class="sidenote">The land of Abexin that of Prester Iohn.</span>
Prester John, a kingdome although it is very great, yet it
extendeth very litle on this coast. From this kingdome or
poynt, going to the southwest, is six hundreth leagues to
Mazanbique, whereas there is inhabitance of Portingals.
All this coast is black people, gentiles, and idolaters, and is
in fifteene degrees in altitude towardes the south, and in the
<span class="sidenote">Mazanbiqua.</span>
same maner are all the rest that are inhabited from Mazanbique
vnto the Cape of Buena Esperansa. They are without
memorie of the preaching of the gospel; if that God for
his mercy doe not take pitie on them, and put into the heartes
of some to goe thither, and to procure the remedie of so
infinite number of soules.</p>

<p>So after the sayd father had informed himselfe of all that
is sayde, and of many other thinges more, which is left out
for to euitate tediousnes, till such time as of them may bee
made a particular historie, hee departed from Goa and Cochin
<span class="sidenote">The Ilands of Maldivia.</span>
towardes Portingall, and passed by the Ilandes of Maldivia,
which are many, and all are inhabited with Moores, nigh
vnto the which they doe enter the poole Antartico, crossing
the equinoctiall from the coast of Arabia; from thence they
sayled with a faire winde till they came right against the
<span class="sidenote">The Ilands of S. Lorenso.</span>
Iland of Saint Lorenso, which is very great, for that it hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_338" id="Page_ii_338">[338]</a></span>
two hundreth seuentie and fiue leagues of longitude, and
fourescore and tenne of latitude; all inhabited with much
people, very quiet and ciuile: the faith of Christ was neuer
preached amongest them; yet I doo belieue that if it were,
they would quietly receiue the same. Passing from this
<span class="sidenote">The Cape of Buena Esperansa.</span>
ilande, they came vnto the Cape of Buena Esperansa, the
which is another very good iland, whose inhabitants and
dwellers are much like to those of Saint Lorenzo: it is in the
temperate zona, and nigh vnto the straights of Magellanes.
This Cape of Buena Esperansa is called by another name,
the Cape Tormentorio: it is fiue and thirtie degrees large
from the pole antartico. And from Cochin vnto this cape
they put one thousand three hundred fiftie and eight leagues,
that way which they do ordinarily nauigate. When they
doo passe by this cape, they were wont to have great and
<span class="sidenote">The Iland of S. Elena.</span>
strong winds. They go from thence to the Iland of S. Elena,
which is beyond the cape forwards, fiue hundred and seuentie
leagues. It is not inhabited with people, but full of swine,
goats, and great aboundance of partriges, and in all the coast
is great store of fish, the which is taken with great ease; it
is but a little iland, and hath circuit no more than fiue
leagues.</p>

<p>From this ilande they do nauigate foure hundred leagues
vntil they come vnder the equinoctiall, vpon the coast of
<span class="sidenote">Guinea.</span>
Guinea, returning unto the pole artike, in foure and forty
degrees in altitude (which was almost at the same place from
whence he departed at his gooing forth) after hee compassed
the world. They passed in sight of the lande, and from
thence they sayled forwards and sawe other land, vntill they
came vnto Lisborne, hauing (after they had crossed the equinoctiall)
sayled a thousand foure hundred and fiftie leagues.
So that after the aforesaid father, Frier Martin Ignacio, had
made his account of all that he had trauelled from the time
he departed from Siuel, til he returned vnto Lysborne, in
compassing the world, he found that it was nine thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii_339" id="Page_ii_339">[339]</a></span>
and forty leagues by sea and by lande, besides many other
leagues that he trauelled in China and in other parts, of the
which hee dooth make no account. All these leagues are
full of mightie kingdomes, and al, or the most part of them,
are subiect vnto the tyranny of Lucyfer. God, for his infinite
mercy, conuert them, and take pittie on them, as hee
did when that he came from heauen vppon the earth to die
for all, and put into the heart of the king of Spaine, that,
amongst other good workes, the which, with his most Christian
zeale dooth intend and do, for to procure this, which
will be so much vnto the glory of God, and great desert of
honor vnto himselfe, the which he may do very commodiously,
being, as he is at this day, Lord of all the Indies, and of the
biggest part of all that newe world.</p>

<p>This petition is worthy, that all we Christians doo desire
of God, for that his holy name in all the world may be praised
and exalted; and the sonnes of Adam, who for their sinnes
are so dispersed and forgotten of God, and first beginning,
they may go and inioy the happy and glorious kingdome for
the which they were created.</p>

<p>The hyphenation and spelling of the original document have been preserved.</p>

<p>Two instances of missing closing parenthesis are
found on Pages 171 and 263. The colon may be a typo for the closing
parenthesis; but they were left as is. On Page 294, the opening bracket
for a quoted passage was missing (as confirmed by comparison with
another copy of this edition on The Internet Archive). This was added.</p>

<p>The cover image was obtained from The Internet Archive.</p>

<p>For the Index, links were added to pages in the First Volume which has been
posted to Project Gutenberg.</p>
